    <ul>
      <li><?php echo t('Seven million American caregivers provide 80% of the care to vulnerable or ill family members.'); ?></li>
      <li><?php echo t('There are approximately 3.3 million long distance caregivers.'); ?></li>
      <li><?php echo t('Caregivers live an average of 480 miles from the people for which they care.'); ?></li>
      <li><?php echo t('Caregivers spend an average of four hours traveling to that person.'); ?></li>
      <li><?php echo t('15 millions days are missed from work each year because of long distance caregiving.'); ?></li>
      <li><?php echo t('The number of long distance caregivers will double over the next 15 years.'); ?></li>
    </ul>
    <p><?php echo t('Long distance caregiving can range from providing physical care to helping with bills or just paying a visit. The good news is that you are not on your own as a long distance caregiver. There are many resources available. Sometimes, the main issue is not the availability of resources, but acceptance by older adults to receiving outside help.'); ?></p>

Assuring your parents that you will look out for them in their best interests and provide quality of care is what is really important. For some illnesses, long-term care may be the sole option. Discovering too late that such promises cannot be kept has often resulted in terrible feelings of guilt by the caregiver for many years.'); ?></li>
