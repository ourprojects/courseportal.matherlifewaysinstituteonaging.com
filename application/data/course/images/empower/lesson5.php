  <h1>Financial Planning Issues and Key Topics for Caregivers</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>As a caregiver, you will need to evaluate the long-term care needs of your loved one. In making this evaluation, it is important to consider financial options. Long-term financial planning is important for everyone, but it is essential when you are coping with the expense of chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer's or Dementia.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Developing a Plan</p>
    <p>For the security of the caregiver and the patient, long-term financial planning is very important for all parties involved. Planning ahead is essential. Long-term financial planning is very important for the security of the caregiver and the patient. If you wish to handle your loved one's finances, you must receive written authorization to do so. This authorization can be obtained through documents such as a power of attorney.</p>
    <p>When considering a financial plan, you may contact professional financial managers and/or medical lawyers who deal with financial planning for people facing chronic or progressive illnesses. Consider an attorney who practices the specialty of “elder law.” <a href="http://www.naela.org/" target="_blank">The National    Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA)</a> is a professional organization that publishes an “Experience Registry” of members who specialize in various aspects of elder law.</p>
    <p>You also may want to talk to a social worker and investigate other resources, such as those available on the Internet. Ask your loved one's doctor for a referral, or speak with a national association or support group to find reputable professionals in your region.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Understanding Medical Coverage</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your loved one is insured, either through his or her employer or retirement policy, read all of the policies pertaining to chronic/progressive illnesses. If you are unsure about the language or terms, contact the personnel department or your financial planner.</li>
      <li>If your loved one is unemployed and does not have coverage, look for the highest level of affordable coverage.</li>
      <li>If your loved one is 65 or over, he or she qualifies for Medicare. This insurance can be    supplemented with a &quot;Medigap&quot; policy available through a private insurer. Many states also  have prescription assistance/reimbursement programs for low-income senior citizens.</li>
      <li>If your loved one is disabled but does not qualify for Social Security, he or she may be eligible to receive a form of Medicare for the disabled.</li>
      <li>If your loved one cannot get insurance and his or her income is low, he or she may qualify    for Medicaid, a government &quot;safety net&quot; program that pays for medical costs that exceed a  person's ability to pay.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Investigating Long- and Short-Term Disability Insurance</p>
    <p>If your loved one is employed, have him check to see if his employer has private disability insurance. He or she should contact his employer's human resources to investigate eligibility, the cost of enrolling, and how much of his/her salary it will cover.</p>
    <p>If your loved one is not working, he or she may want to apply for Social Security. If they do not qualify for Social Security, state-run disability programs may be considered.</p>
    <p>If their total income is below a certain level, he or she may qualify for federally subsidized Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If an individual collects SSI, he or she is a candidate for Medicaid regardless of age.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Activity 1 - Financial Planning issues &amp; topics for Caregivers</p>
    <p class="blog">After reading the section material, do you have a plan for your loved-one in place currently and is so what does it consist of? If not, where would you find a template or where would you look to know where to start.</p>

  <h1>Understanding Key Aspects of Medicare</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program providing healthcare benefits to Americans 65 and older, as well as to some disabled individuals under age 65, and people of any age with permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Eligibility for Medicare is linked to Social Security and railroad retirement benefits.</p>
    <p>Medicare has co-payments and deductibles. A deductible is an initial amount the patient is responsible for paying before Medicare coverage begins. A co-payment is a percentage of the amount of covered expense the patient is required to pay.</p>
    <p class="subheader">What Are Medicare's Coverage Options?</p>
    <p>Medicare has several parts:</p>
    <p>Part A Medicare covers hospital bills and includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Inpatient hospital care<br>
      </li>
      <li>Skilled nursing facility care (not custodial or long-term care)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Home health services, including a visiting nurse, or a physical, occupational, or speech therapist<br>
      </li>
      <li>Blood that you receive at a hospital or skilled nursing facility during a covered stay<br>
      </li>
      <li>Medical supplies<br>
      </li>
      <li>Hospice services<br>
      </li>
      <li>Mental health care given in a hospital</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Part B Medicare deals with doctors' bills and includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Doctor charges (not routine physical exams)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Medically necessary ambulance services<br>
      </li>
      <li>Physical, speech, and occupational therapy<br>
      </li>
      <li>Home health care services (physician certification is necessary)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Medical supplies and equipment such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen, and walkers<br>
      </li>
      <li>Transfusion of blood and blood components provided on an outpatient basis<br>
      </li>
      <li>Outpatient medical/surgical supplies and services<br>
      </li>
      <li>Outpatient mental health<br>
      </li>
      <li>Part B Medicare benefits require payment of a monthly premium. A patient must also be entitled to Part A benefits in order to receive Part B benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Part C is the Medicare Advantage Plans:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Part C refers to Medicare Advantage, which are managed care insurance plans you can buy  from private insurers to replace your traditional Medicare coverage.<br>
      </li>
      <li>They include Medicare HMOs, Medicare PPOs, Medicare Special Needs Plans, and  Medicare Private Fee-for-Service Plans.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Part D is the Prescription Insurance Plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Part D, as of January 2006, covers prescription drugs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Depending on your income, you pay a monthly premium and part of the prescription cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Medicare Coverage of Skilled Nursing Care Facilities</p>
    <p>If nursing home care becomes necessary, your loved one may be eligible for Medicare. In order to receive care in a skilled nursing home under Medicare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most patients' HMO plans require them to have had a three-day hospital stay prior to admission into the skilled nursing facility. There are exceptions, however, and the patient's insurance provider should be consulted to determine whether these restrictions apply.</li>
      <li>The patient must meet specific criteria to receive treatment. The patient's doctor or nurse will help him or her to determine if the criteria are met.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The patient must be admitted into the skilled nursing facility within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The patient must enter the skilled nursing facility for treatment of the same condition for which he or she was hospitalized.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The patient must require daily skilled care.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The condition must be one that can be improved.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The facility must be Medicare-certified.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The patient's doctor must write a care plan. The care plan must be carried out by the skilled nursing facility. (Once the skilled needs are met, Medicare will no longer pay for services.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Medicare Coverage of Home Care</p>
    <p>In order to receive home care under Medicare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The patient must be homebound.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The doctor must certify a plan of care.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Care must be needed on an intermittent (not continuous) basis.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Care cannot exceed 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Physical or speech therapy must be provided on a &quot;necessary and reasonable&quot; basis. There  are no restrictions on the number of days or hours per week of these therapies.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If a person qualifies for home health care, he or she is entitled to a home health aide to provide some personal care.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Activity 2 - Discuss Medicare</p>
    <p class="blog"> Please locate 3 website that you find that have relevant, updated information on Medicare in your area and write them down in a safe place you will remember for your records. </p>
    <p class="subheader">Medicare Coverage for Prescription Drugs (Medicare Part D)</p>
    <p>Medicare prescription drug coverage is insurance that covers both brand-name and generic prescription drugs at participating pharmacies. Medicare prescription drug coverage provides protection for people who have very high drug costs or from unexpected prescription drug bills in the future.</p>
    <p>Everyone with Medicare is eligible for this coverage, regardless of income and resources, health status, or current prescription expenses. Someone may sign up when one is first eligible for Medicare (three months before the month one turns age 65 until three months after turning age 65). If one gets Medicare due to a disability, he or she can join from three months before to three months after the 25th month of cash disability payments. If someone does not sign up when first eligible, a penalty may be assessed. There is an annual open enrollment period from November 15, 2009 to December 31, 2009.</p>
    <p> The decision about Medicare prescription drug coverage depends on the kind of health care coverage one now has. There are two ways to get Medicare prescription drug coverage. One can join a Medicare prescription drug plan or one can join a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare Health Plan that offers drug coverage. Whatever plan chosen, Medicare drug coverage will help cover brand-name and generic drugs at pharmacies that are convenient.</p>
    <p>Like other insurance, there is a monthly premium, which varies by plan, and a yearly deductible. One will also pay a part of the cost of prescriptions, including a copayment or coinsurance. Costs will vary depending on which drug plan is chosen. Some plans may offer more coverage and additional drugs for a higher monthly premium. If someone has limited income and resources, and qualify for extra help, one may not have to pay a premium or deductible. To get more information about the extra help, call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) or visit <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/" target="_blank">www.socialsecurity.gov</a> on the web.</p>
    <p>Medicare prescription drug coverage provides greater peace of mind by protecting older adults from unexpected drug expenses. Even if someone does not use a lot of prescription drugs now,      he or she should still consider joining. As we age, most people need prescription drugs to stay healthy. For most people, joining now means protection from unexpected prescription drug bills in the future.</p>
    <p>There is extra financial help for people with limited income and resources. If someone qualifies for extra help, Medicare will pay for almost all prescription drug costs. One can apply or get more information about the extra help by calling <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/">Social Security</a> at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800- 325-0778) or visiting their website.</p>

    <p class="subheader">Medicare Coverage of Hospice</p>
    <p>Hospice is the philosophy and practice of caring for those at their end-of-life. Hospice care focuses on enhancing the quality of life for those final months, weeks, or days of life.</p>
    <p>There are more than 2,200 hospice organizations across the country. Most provide home care services and respite care for family caregivers. The hospice team consists of physicians, nurses, home health aides, social workers, counselors, nutritionists, speech and physical therapists, clergy, and volunteers who focus on the needs of the dying person and the family. Hospice staffs is usually available on a 24-hour basis. Hospice may be provided in the older adult’s home, a senior living or long-term care community, or in special hospice units in some hospitals or nursing homes if more extensive medical care to control pain or other symptoms is needed to provide peace and comfort.</p>
    <p>The goal of hospice is not to cure or rehabilitate. Nor is it to hasten death. Rather, hospice care focuses on supportive comfort care, aiming at relieving pain, nausea, dizziness, or constipation. </p>
    <p>For the caregiver, it is important to choose a hospice agency that is certified by Medicare to provide hospice care. Almost all hospice services are covered by Medicare as long as the agency is certified.</p>
    <p>Hospice care is given in “periods of care.” For example, initial hospice care usually begins with two 90-day periods (6 months total). After than period, if the hospice medical director determines the person still would benefit from hospice, they would be “recertified” for additional 60-day periods. Recertification continues every 60-days. If the hospice medical director deems the person is doing well and does not need hospice, the care would revert back to the original Medicare coverage. If later, the person again needs hospice, the medical director can recertify the person to return to hospice care.</p>

  <h1>Understanding Key Aspects of Medicaid</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Medicaid is a joint federal-state health insurance program providing medical assistance primarily to low-income Americans who have limited resources. It is also available to people under 65 if they are blind or disabled. The purpose of Medicaid is to provide preventive, therapeutic, and remedial health services and supplies that are essential to attain an optimum level of well-being.</p>
    <p class="subheader">How Do People Receive Medicaid Benefits?</p>
    <p>There are two ways to receive Medicaid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Supplemental Security Income (SSI) -- People who receive a cash grant under SSI and Aid to Dependent Children are automatically eligible for Medicaid benefits.</li>
      <li> Medicaid &quot;spend-down&quot; -- This is similar to a deductible or a co-payment that a patient must 
        pay every month. Once the patient meets his &quot;spend-down&quot; amount, the patient is eligible for</li>
      <li> Medicaid for the remainder of the month.</li>
      <li> Who Is Eligible for Medicaid?</li>
      <li> Medicaid eligibility requirements depend on financial need, low income, and minimal assets.<br>
      </li>
      <li>In determining Medicaid eligibility, officials do not review rent, car payments, or food costs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Officials only review medical expenses, which include:<br>
        <ul>
          <li> Care from hospitals, doctors, clinics, nurses, dentists, podiatrists, and chiropractors<br>
          </li>
          <li> Medications<br>
          </li>
          <li> Medical supplies and equipment<br>
          </li>
          <li> Health insurance premiums<br>
          </li>
          <li> Transportation to get medical care<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> The four eligibility tests required to receive Medicaid include:<br>
        <ul>
          <li> Categorical -- A patient must be age 65, blind, or disabled.<br>
          </li>
          <li> Non-financial -- A patient must be a U.S. citizen and a state resident. A patient also must have a Social Security number.<br>
          </li>
          <li> Financial -- A patient's total gross income, personal assets, and property will be evaluated and must meet a certain standard. This amount varies from state to state.<br>
          </li>
          <li> Procedural -- A patient must complete and sign an application and have a personal interview with a Medicaid official.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each eligible Medicaid recipient receives a monthly Medical Identification card. The card is valid for one month only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Medicaid Coverage</p>
    <p>Medicaid coverage varies from state to state. For specific coverage guidelines, contact your state's Department of Human Services. Generally, Medicaid benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transportation -- This may include ambulance services when other means of transportation are detrimental to the patient's health or may include transportation to and from the hospital at time of admission or discharge when required by the patient's condition. Transportation also may cover trips to and from a hospital, outpatient clinic, doctor's office, or other facility when the doctor certifies the need for this service.</li>
      <li>Ambulatory Centers -- Ambulatory health care centers are private corporations or public agencies that are not part of a hospital. They provide preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services under the direction of a physician. Ambulatory services covered by Medicaid include dental, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and vision care.</li>
      <li> Hospital Services -- These services include inpatient hospital care up to 60 days for an illness. Private hospital rooms are covered only when the illness requires the patient to be isolated for his or her own health or the health of others. Outpatient preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services also are covered. So are professional, laboratory and radiology services.</li>
      <li> Medical Supplies and Medications -- These include general medical supplies (when prescribed by a physician), as well as medications prescribed by a physician, dentist, or podiatrist. Durable medical equipment (such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, side rails, oxygen administration apparatus, and special safety aids, etc.) also is covered.</li>
      <li> Home Health Care -- These services include those provided by a visiting nurse, home health    aide, or physical therapist.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Skilled Nursing Facilities -- Skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities (providing short-term care for a patient whose condition is stable or reversible) are covered through<br>
      </li>
      <li>Medicaid with a doctor's authorization.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Legal Issues for Caregivers</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>As a caregiver, you should begin making legal preparations soon after your loved one has been diagnosed with a serious illness. People with Alzheimer's disease and other long-term illnesses may have the capacity to manage their own legal and financial affairs right now. But as these diseases advance, they will need to rely on others to act in their best interests. This transition is never easy. However, advance planning allows people with a long-term disease and their families to make decisions together for what may come.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Legal Documents for Caregivers</p>
    <p>Clearly written legal documents that outline your loved one's wishes and decisions are essential 
      for caregivers. These documents can authorize another person to make healthcare and financial decisions, including plans for long-term care. If the person being cared for has the legal capacity -- the level of mental functioning necessary to sign official documents -- he or she should actively participate in legal planning.</p>
    <p>To give your loved one the best care possible, obtain legal advice and services from an attorney. If the person you're caring for is age 65 or older, consider hiring an attorney who practices elder law, a specialized area of law focusing on issues that typically affect the elderly. As you plan for the future, ask the attorney about the following documents (more detailed information is provided in the section “Long-term Care Planning and Advanced Directives):</p>
    <p>Power of attorney<br>
      This document gives a person (the principal) an opportunity to authorize an agent (usually a trusted family member or friend) to make legal decisions when he or she is no longer competent. There is no standard power of attorney; thus, each one must be geared toward an individual's situation. It is important for the caregiver to be very familiar with the terms of power of attorney because they spell out what authority the caregiver does and does not have. The agent should make multiple copies of the document and give one to each company with which the principal does business.</p>
    <p>Durable power of attorney for health care (also known as health care proxy)<br>
      This document appoints an agent to make all decisions regarding health care, including choices regarding health care providers, medical treatment, and, in the later stages of the disease, end- of-life decisions. This means that the agent may authorize or refuse any medical treatment for the principal. This power only goes into effect once the principal is unable to make decisions for himself and is activated by the principal's attending physician.</p>
    <p>Living will<br>
      A living will allows the person to state -- in advance -- what kind of medical care he or she desires to receive and what life-support procedures he or she would like to withhold. This document is used if a person becomes terminally ill and unable to make his wishes known or if he becomes permanently unconscious. A terminal illness is defined as one from which a person's doctor believes there is no chance of recovery. Living wills can also be used if a person becomes permanently unconscious. To be considered permanently unconscious, two physicians must determine that the patient has no reasonable possibility of regaining<br>
      consciousness or decision-making ability. Laws on living wills vary from state to state.</p>
    <p>Living trust<br>
      This document enables a person (called a grantor or trustor) to create a trust and appoint a trustee to carefully invest and manage trust assets once the grantor is no longer able to manage finances. A person can appoint another individual or a financial institution to be the trustee.</p>
    <p>Will<br>
      A will is a document created by an individual that names an executor (the person who will manage the estate) and beneficiaries (those who will receive the estate at the time of the person's death).</p>
    <p>If you cannot afford an attorney, legal forms can be accessed through resources including books and the Internet. Legal issues may be discussed with a social worker or clergy free of charge.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Guardian/Conservator</p>
    <p>A caregiver of an individual who no longer has the legal capacity to execute powers of attorney or trusts may have to become that individual's guardian or conservator. A guardian has the legal authority to make decisions about the lifestyle and well-being of another person. The decisions a guardian may make include where a person may live, what care and medical treatment will be provided, and what religious and educational activities will be made available. A conservator has<br>
      legal authority to manage another person's financial affairs.</p>
