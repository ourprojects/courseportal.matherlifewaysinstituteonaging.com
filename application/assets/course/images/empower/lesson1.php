  <h1>Caregiver Resources</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Too often caregivers neglect their own health and well-being, and put their own needs <em>on the back burner</em>. Sometimes caregivers become a second victim of the disease that afflicts their family member. It's sad when someone says, <em>My mother was the ill person, but her illness destroyed my father</em>. Usually, we cannot stop the impact of a chronic illness on a family member. However, we are responsible for our own       self-care.</p>
    <p>When you board an airplane, the flight attendant gives several safety instructions. One of them is, <em>If oxygen masks drop down, put on your oxygen mask first before helping others. </em> This is because if you don't take care of yourself first, you may not be able to help those who need your help. It's the same thing with caregiving. When you take care of yourself, everyone benefits. Ignoring your own needs is not only potentially
      detrimental to you, but it can also be harmful to the person who depends on you.</p>
    <p>The <em>Resource</em> section was designed to give you additional details in order to help you maintain personal well-being while providing quality care to your family member. Many focus on  tools to help you to take care of you. These tools will help you</p>
    <ul>
      <li>set goals and make action plans.</li>
      <li> identify and reduce personal stress.</li>
      <li> make your thoughts and feelings work for you, not against you.</li>
      <li> communicate your feelings, needs, and concerns in positive ways.</li>
      <li> cope with difficult situations, including asking for help and setting limits.</li>
      <li> deal with emotions, especially feelings of anger, guilt, and depression.</li>
      <li> make tough caregiving decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional resources will address special concerns and decisions you may face as a caregiver. These include what to do when a family member is no longer a safe driver, hiring in-home help, using community services, how to communicate with and respond to a family member who is memory impaired, options available when a family member is having problems managing his money; coping with depression, and making a decision about a care
      facility. You can turn to resources for guidance and direction when you face a specific decision or concern.</p>
    <p class="subheader">How Much Support Do You Have?</p>
    <p>Mark the box in the scale to show how much support you feel from each resource. After you have completed the survey, think about what you can do to gain more support from these individuals. Again, this is simply a <em>visual</em>, and is not meant to be printed.</p>

  <h1>Managing Self-Care</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Managing our self-care means that as caregivers we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take responsibility - We realize we are responsible for our personal well-being and for getting our needs met. This includes maintaining activities and relationships that are meaningful to us.</li>
      <li>Have realistic expectations - We fully understand our family member's medical condition and we are realistic about what our family member can and cannot do. The more you know about your family member's medical condition, the better you will be able to plan successful caregiving
        strategies. Knowledge is power. It's also important to look at your definition of a <em>good caregiver</em>. Unrealistic expectations can set you up for feelings of failure, resentment, and guilt. Placing burdensome expectations on yourself does not make you a better caregiver. In fact, you are much more likely to become an exhausted, irritable, and resentful caregiver... and then to feel guilty!</li>
      <li>Focus on what we can do - It's important to be clear about what you can and cannot change. For example, you will not be able to change a person who has always been demanding and inflexible, but you can control how you respond to that person's demands. You can <em>accept</em> and <em>let-go</em> of-the things you cannot change. Managing your self-care also means you seek solutions to what you can change.</li>
      <li> Communicate effectively with others - These include family members, friends, health care professionals, and the care receiver. Don't expect others to know what you need. Recognize it is your responsibility to tell others about your needs and concerns. Communicate in ways that are positive and avoid being demanding, manipulative, or guilt provoking when you make requests.</li>
      <li> Learn from our emotions - Realize there will be emotional ups and downs. Listen to your emotions and what they are telling you. Don't bottle up your emotions. Repressing or denying feelings decreases energy, causes irritability, depression, and physical problems, and affects your judgment and ability to make the best decisions. Also, don't strike out at others. You are in control of your emotions, your emotions don't control you.</li>
      <li>Get help when needed - An important part of self-care is knowing when you need help and how to find it. Help can be from community resources, family and friends, or professionals. Most important is that you do not wait until you are <em>hanging at the end of your rope</em> before you get help. Don't wait until you are overwhelmed or exhausted, or your health fails. Reaching out for help, when needed, is a sign of personal strength.</li>
      <li>Set goals and work toward them - Be realistic in the goals that you set and take steps toward reaching those goals. Seek solutions to the problems that you experience. Changes do not need to be major to make a significant difference. In summary, self-care means that you seek ways to take better care of yourself. As a caregiver, you don't just survive. You thrive!</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Ask yourself the following questions about your caregiving:</p>

    <p class="subheader">Trying To Do It All</p>
    <p>One problem that caregivers frequently experience is trying to do it all and doing it all alone. Is it possible to do it all? The answer to the question can be both <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>. It really depends on you. What is critical is how you define what it means to <em>do it all</em> and, whether or not your definition of <em>doing it all</em> includes taking care of yourself so that you thrive, and not just survive.</p>
    <p>To Maxine, the answer to the question "Is it possible to do it all?" was "no." She says, "Mother's needs are endless and no matter what I do, I can never make her happy." Yet, at the same time, Maxine was trying to do it all. Her mother's care dominated Maxine's life. Another caregiver, Maria, answered "yes" to the question, "Is it possible to do it all?" She explained that "All that needed to be done for my mother was done."</p>
    <p> A major difference between Maxine and Maria was the rules by which they operated. Maxine operated by the rule, "I must do everything for my mother." The rule had become, "I must help Mama at all costs." As a result, her relationships with other family members suffered and Maxine found herself becoming increasingly resentful. Maxine's feelings of wanting to do everything is legitimate, but the actions associated with her feelings usually are impossible to carry out.</p>
    <p>As a result, Maxine experiences feelings of failure and lack of success. Maria was more realistic. She recognized that the things she wanted to be done whether they were her desires, her mother's desires, or the desires of others-were not the same as the things that needed to be done. Maria's goal was to make her mother as comfortable as possible, without sacrificing herself and the other important relationships in her life. She also got help from family and a community agency in meeting her mother's needs. Maria said:</p>
    <p>To some degree I recognized that caregiving was like a job and my goal was to find the best way to get the job done. A friend also told me that doing any job well-including the job of caregiving requires four things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Recognizing you can't do everything yourself-you work with others.
      <li>Taking daily breaks.
      <li>Taking vacations to renew oneself.
      <li>Being realistic about what you can do... </li>
    </ol>
    <p> There was another difference between Maxine and Maria. Maxine felt it was selfish to think of herself. Maria, on the other hand, viewed that if she was going to be there for the long haul, she must take care of herself, and make sure that she had pleasurable moments in her life.</p>
    <p>As a caregiver, you are more likely to "be there" for your family member who needs your care and to be a more loving and patient caregiver when you meet some of your own needs. It's important to "fill your own cup" and not allow it to "run dry." It's not being selfish to focus on your own
      needs and desires when you are a caregiver to a family member who has a chronic ·or progressive illness. It's important to ask yourself, "If my health deteriorates, or I die, what will happen to the person I provide care for? If I get emotionally drained, become deprived of sleep, or become isolated because I am trying to do it all, how loving am I likely to be to my family member?"</p>
    <p class="subheader">Taking Time for Yourself</p>
    <p>Do you value yourself and your personal needs? What do you do for personal renewal? Do you save some time for yourself out of each day? Do you take occasional extended breaks? Or are you so involved with caregiving tasks that you have little or no time for yourself?</p>
    <p>What activities do you enjoy? What would you like to do that would give you a lift? When was the last time you gave yourself a treat?</p>
    <p>Breaks in caregiving are a must. They are as important to health as diet, sleep, rest, and exercise. It's important not to lose sight of your personal needs and interests. Studies show that sacrificing yourself in the care of another and removing pleasurable events from your life can lead to emotional exhaustion, depression, and physical illness. You have a right-even a responsibility-to take some time away from caregiving.</p>
    <p> Regular breaks from the tasks of caregiving are essential. Decide on the time, date, and activity-then follow through. Breaks don't have to be long to make a positive difference. It's important to plan some time for yourself in every day, even if that time is only for 15 minutes or half an hour. Most important is to do something that "fills your cup" and helps you to feel better and thrive. If you have difficulty taking breaks for
      yourself, consider taking them for your family member. Care receivers also benefit from caregivers getting breaks.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Setting Goals</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>An important tool in taking care of yourself is setting goals. A goal is something you would like to accomplish in the next three to six months: What would you like to do to take better care of yourself and to help yourself to thrive? This might be to get a break from caregiving for a week, get help with caregiving tasks, be able to walk three miles, or quit feeling guilty.</p>
    <p>Goals often are difficult to accomplish because they may seem like dreams or they may be overwhelming. As a result, we may not even try to accomplish them or we may give up shortly after we get started. We will address this problem shortly.</p>
    <p class="blog">For now, take a moment and write at least 3 goals on the Forum. Put an asterisk (*) next to the goal you would like to work on first. After identifying a goal, the first step is to brainstorm all of the different things you might do to reach your goal. Identify and write down all possible options on the Forum as a separate posting.</p>
    <p>The second step is to evaluate the options you have identified. Which options seem like possibilities to you? It's important not to assume that an option is unworkable or doesn't exist until you have thoroughly investigated it or given it a try. Assumptions are major self-care enemies. Put an asterisk (*) next to two or three options you would like to try. Select one to try. The third step is to turn your option into a short-term plan, which we call making an action plan.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Making Action Plans</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>An action plan is a specific action that you are confident you can accomplish within the next week. It's an agreement or contract with yourself.</p>
    <p>Action plans are one of your most important self-care tools. An action. plan is a step toward reaching your long-term goal. It is to be something you want to do. It is not to be something you feel you should do, have to do, or need to do. The intent of making an action plan is to help you to feel better and to take better care of yourself. Remember, an action plan is a "want to do." Here are the five steps for making an action plan: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide what you want to do.</li>
      <li> Make your plan behavior-specific.</li>
      <li> Make a specific plan. </li>
      <li>Determine your confidence level. </li>
      <li>Write down your action plan. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="subheader">Decide What You Want To Do</p>
    <p> Think about what is realistic for you to accomplish within the next week. It's important that an action plan is reachable; otherwise, you are likely to experience frustration. An action plan is to help you experience success-not frustration, increased stress, or failure. An action plan starts with the words, "I will ... " If you find yourself saying "I will try to ... ," "I have to ... ," or "I should ... ," then re-examine your action plan. It probably is not something that you truly want to do.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Make Your Plan Behavior-Specific</p>
    <p>The more specific your action plan, the greater your chances of accomplishing it. For example, "taking better care of myself" is not a specific behavior. However, making an appointment for a physical check-up, walking three times a week, getting a massage on Thursday afternoon, or asking
      someone to stay with your family member for one morning are all specific behaviors. "I will relax" also is not a specific behavior; however, reading a book, listening to your favorite music, or puttering in the garden are specific behaviors.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Make a Specific Plan</p>
    <p>Making a specific plan is often difficult, yet it is the most important part of making an action plan. A specific plan answers these four questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What are you going to do? - Examples: I will read (book name) for pleasure. Or, I will walk.</li>
      <li>How much will you do? - Examples: Will you read one chapter or will you read for a half hour? Will you walk two blocks or for 20 minutes?</li>
      <li>When will you do this? Examples: Will you read the first thing in the morning when you awaken, before you go to bed, when the care receiver is sleeping, or ... ? If your plan is to walk, when during the day will you do it ?</li>
      <li> How often will you do this activity? Example: Three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A common mistake is to make an action plan that is unreachable within the time frame. For example, if you plan to do something every day, you might fail. Caregiving, and life in general, has its surprises. Although well-intentioned, it's often not possible to do something every day. It's better to plan to do something once or twice a week and exceed your action plan than to plan to do something every day and fail because you only did it six days, rather than seven. Remember, an action plan is meant to help you to take better care of yourself and to experience success. The last thing you need is additional pressure, disappointment, and stress.</p>
    <p>Here are two recommendations for writing an action plan that can help you achieve success.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start where you are or start slowly. If there is a book you have been wanting to read, but just have not found the time, it may not be realistic to expect to read the entire book in the next week. Instead, try reading for a half hour twice during the week If you haven't been physically active, it may be unrealistic to make an action plan· to start walking three miles. It is better to make your action plan for something that you believe you can accomplish. For example, make your plan for walking three blocks or a half mile, rather than three miles.</li>
      <li>Give yourself time off. We all have days when we don't feel like doing anything. That's the advantage of saying you will do something three days a week, rather than every day. That way, if you don't feel like doing something on one day, or something develops that prevents you from doing it, you can still achieve your action plan.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="subheader">Determine Your Confidence Level</p>
    <p>Once you have made your action plan, ask yourself the following question: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not at all confident and 10 being totally confident, how confident am I that I can complete my action plan? If your answer is 7 or above, your action plan is probably realistic and reachable. However, if your answer is 6 or below, it's important to take another look at your action plan. Something probably needs to be adjusted.
    <p>Ask yourself: <em>What makes me uncertain about accomplishing my action plan? What problems do I foresee?</em> Then, see if you either find a solution to the problems you identified or change your action plan to a new one in which you feel greater confidence.
    <p class="subheader">Write Down Your Action Plan
    <p>Once you are satisfied with your action plan, write it down. Putting an action plan in writing helps us to remember, keep track of, and accomplish the agreement we have made with ourselves. Keep track of how you are doing. Write down the problems you encounter in carrying out your action plan. Check off activities as you accomplish them. If you made an adjustment in your action plan, make a note of what you did.
    <p>At the end of the week, review your action plan. Ask yourself, "Am l nearer to accomplishing my goal?" "How do I feel about what I did?" What obstacles or problems, if any, did I encounter?" Taking stock is important. If you are having problems, this is the time to seek solutions.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Problem-Solving: A Solution-Seeking Approach</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Sometimes you may find that your action plan is not workable. You may encounter unusual circumstances that week and need to give the plan a try for at least another week or you may need to make adjustments in your original plan. The following solution seeking approach can help you identify solutions to problems.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly identify the problem. This is the first and most important step in the solution-seeking approach. It also can be the most difficult step. </li>
      <li>List ideas to solve the problem. Family, friends, and others may be helpful in giving ideas. When you ask for ideas, just listen to each suggestion. It's best not to respond as to why an idea is or isn't likely to work. Just focus on getting the ideas.</li>
      <li> Select one to try. When trying a new idea, give it a fair trial before deciding that it won't work.</li>
      <li> Assess the results. Ask yourself, "How well did what I chose work?" If all went well, congratulate yourself for finding a solution to the identified problem. If the first idea didn't work, try another idea. Sometimes an idea just needs fine-tuning. It's important not to give up on an idea just because it didn't work the first time. If you have difficulty finding a solution that works, utilize other resources. Share your problem with family, friends, and professionals and ask them for possible ideas. If you still find that suggested solutions do not work, you may need to accept that the problem is not solvable right now.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, just because there  doesn't seem to be a workable solution right now doesn't mean that a problem can't be solved later, or that
      other problems can't be solved in the same way. It may be helpful to go back to the first step and consider if the problem needs to be redefined. For example, a caregiver had thought that her problem was "I am tired all of the time." However, the real problem was the caregiver's beliefs that "No one can care for John like I can," and "I have to do everything myself." As a result of these beliefs, the caregiver was doing everything herself and getting worn out. When she redefined the problem and focused on changing her beliefs and view of the caregiving situation, she found a workable solution. Sometimes, too, a problem may be easier to work on if you break it down into smaller problems.</p>
    <p>Most of the time if you follow these steps, you will find a solution that solves the problem. It's important to avoid making the mistake of jumping from step l to step 7 and thinking "nothing can be done."</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Reward Yourself</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Accomplishing action plans is often a reward in itself. However, it's also important to find healthy pleasures that add enjoyment to your life. Rewards don't have to be fancy or expensive or take a lot of time. One caregiver; for example, regularly goes to a movie or a play as a gift to herself from her husband. She said:</p>
    <p>When my husband was well, he would take me out Friday nights to a movie or a play at least twice a month. Because of his medical condition, he is no longer able to do so. Now a friend and I go to a movie or a play at least once a month. I consider this is a treat that my husband is still
      giving to me.</p>
    <p>Another caregiver said:</p>
    <p>Before my wife's illness, I would go golfing with my buddies on Saturday morning. When Carmela needed more care, I quit golfing. I now treat myself to Saturday golfing, while my daughter or a friend visits with Carmela. This gives me something to look forward to each week and I feel more alive when I return home. I'm also finding I am more patient with Carmela. My daughter says I am always happier and calmer when I return home.
      So, I look at Saturday golfing as my treat not only to me, but also to Carmela.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>My Action Plan</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p> In review, a caregiver who practices selfcare does the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sets goals.</li>
      <li>Identifies a variety of options for reaching a goal</li>
      <li>Makes an action plan toward accomplishing the goal.</li>
      <li> Carries out the action plan.</li>
      <li> Assesses how well the action plan is working.</li>
      <li> Makes adjustments, as necessary, in the action plan.</li>
      <li>Rewards himself or herself.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Not all goals are achievable. Sometimes we must accept that what we want to do is not possible at this time, and we must let go of the idea. Be realistic about goals and don't dwell on what can't be done.</p>
    <p>Consider what is likely to happen to the caregiver who is driven by a goal to make her mother happy. Given her mother's personality, this goal may be completely unachievable. Such a goal creates a heavy burden and a caregiver is not likely to achieve it. However, an achievable goal       might be to provide a pleasurable activity for her mother at least once a week perhaps taking her to get her hair done, visiting a friend, watching a comedy on television, or working together on a project her mother enjoys.</p>
    <p>Remember, what is important in caregiving is not just to survive, but to thrive!</p>
