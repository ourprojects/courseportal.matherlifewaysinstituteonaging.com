  <h1>Reducing Personal Stress</h1>
  <p>This lesson contains two main sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Stress of Caregiving<br>
    </li>
    <li>Steps to Maintain Health &amp; Avoid Stress</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This lesson explores the stress of caregiving. It will help you identify and understand your particular stressors, challenges, and strengths. You can then plan strategies that help you cope, change, and reduce stress. A basic premise of this chapter is that each of us has a reservoir of strength. The challenge is to identify our strengths build on them.</p>
  <h1>The Stress of Caregiving</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p> There has been so much written about stress it has become a household word. Studies show that a certain amount of stress is helpful. It can challenge us to change and motivate us to do things we might not do otherwise. However, when the amount of stress overwhelms our ability to cope with
      it, we feel 'distress' or 'burnout.'</p>
    <p>According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/distress" target="_blank">Webster's Dictionary</a>, distress
      is 'suffering of mind or body; severe physical or mental strain.' As a caregiver, you no doubt have increased stress in your
      life, whether you are caring for a mother with early Parkinson's disease, who is still able to care for her personal needs, or a spouse who doesn't recognize you because of advanced Alzheimer's disease.</p>
    <p class="blog">Write you own definition of 'distress' on the Forum.</p>
    <p>Each caregiving situation is unique. What is stressful for you may not be stressful for someone else. In his book The Survivor Personality, AI Siebert says, "there is no
      stress until you feel a strain." Since the feeling of stress is subjective and unique to each individual, it is difficult to define objectively. The stress you feel is not only the result of your caregiving situation, it is all of your perception of it. Your stress will
      increase or decrease depending on how you perceive your circumstances. And your perception will affect how you respond.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Factors That Affect Stress</p>
    <p> Your level of stress is influenced by many factors, including: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> whether your caregiving is voluntary or not: </li>
      <li> your relationship with the care receiver.</li>
      <li> your coping abilities.</li>
      <li> your caregiving situation. </li>
      <li> whether support is available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether your caregiving
      is voluntary or not  
      -
    <p>Many people become caregivers voluntarily. Others acquire the role because no one else is available. When you become a caregiver voluntarily, you are making a choice. However, if you "inherited" the job and feel you had no choice, the chances are greater for experiencing strain, distress,
      and resentment. Nancy became a caregiver because no one else was available.
    <p>Nancy couldn't have been more surprised when the visiting nurse asked her if she was the primary caregiver for her mother in-law, Joan. Nancy was fond of Joan. She called and stopped by frequently to see how Joan was managing, but hadn't thought of herself as the primary caregiver. It was apparent that Joan's medical condition was worsening and she was becoming increasingly weak Nancy realized there were no other children or relatives available, so she agreed, although somewhat reluctantly, to be Joan's caregiver. Nancy felt anxious and uncertain about what it meant to be a primary caregiver and whether she had the necessary skills to perform the role.
    <p>Luckily, Nancy and Joan had a good relationship and they were able to communicate openly, minimizing some of the potential for stress. You can't always think about a caregiving relationship in advance, but if you can, it has greater potential for success.</p>
    <p>Your relationship with the care receiver -</p>
    <p>If your relationship with the care receiver has been difficult, becoming a caregiver is more of a challenge. If the care receiver has always been demanding and controlling, you will probably feel more stress, anger, and resentment. Sometimes people are caregiving with the hope of healing a relationship. The healing may or may not happen. If healing doesn't happen, the caregiver may feel regret, depressed, and discouraged. A professional counselor, spiritual advisor, or trusted friend can help deal with such feelings and emotions.</p>
    <p>Your coping abilities -</p>
    <p>How you have coped with stress in the past predicts how you will cope now. Did you find constructive ways to manage your stress? Perhaps you were able to find time to exercise regularly and generally take care of yourself. Or did you rely on alcohol or drugs to help you cope? Sometimes people rely on medications and alcohol in times of stress, which only makes matters worse. It is important to identify your current coping strengths and build on them. Learning new coping skills also will help make your caregiving situation less stressful.</p>
    <p>The caregiving situation - </p>
    <p>What does your caregiving situation require of you? Does it require 24-hour-aday availability? Or do you just need to make an occasional telephone call to check on the person? What disease does the care receiver have? Does he have a mental or physical disability, or both? Certain caregiving situations are more stressful than others. For example, caring for someone who has a dementia such as Alzheimer's disease is often more stressful than caring for someone with a physical limitation. Also, stress tends to be highest when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the caregiving situation continues for a long time.</li>
      <li>the care receiver's needs gradually increase.</li>
      <li> caregivers feel they have limited or no support.</li>
      <li>caregivers have their own health/physical problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether support is available -</p>
    <p>Caregivers who feel isolated and without adequate support usually experience a higher level of stress. Support may be lacking for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The caregiver may resist accepting help, even when he or she needs it.</li>
      <li> Others may be willing to help but don't offer because they are uncomfortable around the ill person, frightened of the illness, or don't know what they can do.</li>
      <li>Others don't want to interfere, especially if the caregiver seems to have everything under control and has refused help in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Caregiver stress is influenced by many factors, including the need to adapt to ongoing changes and losses caused by the care receiver's illness. These changes cause you to redefine your life. What was normal has changed. You are living with a new reality.</p>

  <h1>Steps to Maintain Health &amp; Avoid Stress</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Whatever causes stress in your life, too much of it can lower your resistance to disease and lead to "burnout." Current research shows that there is a _close connection between stress and health. Unrelieved stress is on,e of many factors that cause illness. Research also shows that thoughts and emotions affect the immune system, which is the first line of defense against disease. It is possible to strengthen the immune system by reducing stress. The following four steps will help you maintain your health and avoid distress:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Recognize your warning signs of stress.</li>
      <li>Identify your sources of stress.</li>
      <li>Identify what you can and cannot change.</li>
      <li>Take action to manage your stress.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each of these steps will be discussed in detail.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Step 1: Recognize Your
      Warning Signs of Stress -</p>
    <p>The first step in managing stress is to be aware of how it affects you. What are your warning signs and symptoms of stress? The following are signs that may occur when you experience an unusual amount of stress. Answering these questions can help you identify your own warning signs. What is usually your earliest sign of stress? It's important to recognize stress early and do something about it, before it causes you serious problems. For one caregiver, the early sign might be increased irritability. For another, it might be lying awake for hours before falling asleep. For another, it might be fatigue and a lack of energy.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, too, when we are involved in a situation, we may not listen to our early warning signs, but they are voiced in the words of others: "You look so tired," "You get upset so easily lately," "Why are you snapping at me?" If you hear such statements, it is a "red light" warning sign. Just as a flashing red light on your car's dashboard warns you that something is wrong with your car, we also display warning signals. What happens if we ignore the early red flashing light on the car's dashboard? What happens if we ignore our personal early warning signals?</p>
    <p>Do you listen to your early warning signals? What are they? And what do you do about them? Warning signs usually mean we need to stop, valuate what's happening, and make some changes. The earlier warning signals are recognized, the greater the chance of avoiding or reducing the destructive effects of stress.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="subheader">Step 2: Identify Your Sources of Caregiving Stress -</p>
    <p>The second step in managing stress is to recognize what causes your stress. Not all stressors are the result of caregiving. Other sources can affect your ability to be a caregiver. The following questions include many common sources of stress. Thinking about these questions can help you recognize some of your own sources. </p>
    <p class="blog">Are you experiencing many demands on your time, energy, or money? What are they?</p>
    <p class="blog"> Do you feel you have conflicting responsibilities? Which ones?</p>
    <p class="blog">Are there differences in expectations between your family, your boss, the care receiver, and yourself? What are
      they?</p>
    <p class="blog">Do you feel others don't understand the care receiver's mental or physical condition?</p>
    <p class="blog"> Do you have difficulty meeting the care receiver's physical or emotional needs?</p>
    <p class="blog">Are you pressured by financial decisions and lack of resources?</p>
    <p class="blog">Do you feel a loss of freedom, to the point of feeling trapped?</p>
    <p class="blog"> Is there disagreement among family members?</p>
    <p class="blog"> Do you feel that other family members aren't doing their share?</p>
    <p class="blog">Does the care receiver place unrealistic demands and expectations on you?</p>
    <p class="blog">Is there a lack of open communication between you and the care receiver?</p>
    <p class="blog">Do other family members have negative attitudes that create difficulty for you?</p>
    <p class="blog">Is it painful to watch the care receiver's condition get worse?</p>
    <p class="blog">Are there other problems with children, marriage, job, finances, or
      health? What are they?</p>
    <p>Consider your "yes" answers carefully. The sources of stress you have identified are indicators for change. Use the awareness you have gained in the first two steps to make helpful changes.</p>
    <p>The following story is an example of a caregiver who recognized the source of her distress and made changes to better manage the situation.</p>
    <p>Ernestine was increasingly fatigued, irritable, and depressed with the responsibility of caring for her husband, Richard, who had Parkinson's disease. Richard's condition was steadily getting worse. He
      was bed-bound and needed help with many
      functions. Other family members hadn't
      offered to help, and Ernestine felt abandoned,
      alone, angry, and overwhelmed.
      A few friends and neighbors had offered
      to help but Ernestine refused. When she
      started having health problems, it became
      clear that something had to change. She
      had to have help.</p>
    <p>Because Ernestine had difficulty asking for
      help, she devised a simple plan that would
      give others an opportunity to help without
      having to be asked. She made a list of tasks
      she needed help with and posted it on the refrigerator. The list included such things as vacuuming the living room, grocery shopping, staying with Richard so she could go to church, weeding the garden, picking up audio books at the library, picking up medications at the pharmacy,
      and preparing food. When visitors offered
      to help, Ernestine referred them to the list,
      suggesting they choose a task that suited
      them. This proved to be a successful plan
      for everyone.</p>
    <p>It's important to identify the causes of
      your stress before they overwhelm you.
      Don't wait until you develop health
      problems, as Ernestine did. Many caregivers
      keep going until they become ill. You can
      only be an effective caregiver if you are
      healthy. Self-sacrifice to the point of illness
      benefits no one and is not required or
      recommended.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Step 3: Identify What You Can and
      Cannot Change -</p>
    <p>A major challenge of caregiving is to not only survive, but to rebuild your life and thrive. This is possible once you know the sources and signs of your stress. Then you can determine those you can do something about and those that are beyond your control. Step three is to identify what you can and cannot change </p>
    <p>Identifying what you can change gives you a sense of control over events. However, it isn't easy to determine what can and cannot be changed. Too often people try to change things they have no control over. For example, someone who focuses on trying to change another person usually ends up more frustrated. The only person
      you can change is yourself. You may be able
      to change a situation, how you respond to
      it, or your perception of it, but you can't
      change another person. It wastes valuable
      time and energy trying to change what is
      outside of your control. Some situations can't be changed.
      However, you may be able to manage them
      better if you change your outlook about
      a situation, or decide to 'roll with the
      punches.'</p>
    <p>The frustration and hopelessness that
      result from trying to change the unchangeable are self-defeating and can adversely
      affect a relationship, as in the case of Hal
      and Sue.</p>
    <p>Sue and Hal had been a socially active
      couple. Sue was diagnosed with early
      Parkinson's disease and gradually started
      backing out of social plans because she
      didn't feel up to it. Since the beginning of
      the disease Sue has been on a roller coaster
      of having good days and bad days. Hal
      encourages Sue to go out when she doesn't
      feel like it, urging her to 'snap out of it.'  
      He wants things to remain as they were.</p>
    <p>Hal is frustrated in his attempts to change
      the effect of the disease on their lives. By
      not accepting Sue's feelings, he is adding
      stress to their relationship. But recently he
      has learned more about Parkinson's disease
      and is trying to be more realistic and
      flexible about what he can and cannot
      change. Flexibility is crucial. A Japanese
      saying is:</p>
    <p>'In a storm, it is the bamboo, the flexible tree,
      that can bend with the wind and survive. The
      rigid tree that resists the wind falls, victim of
      its own insistence on control.'</p>
    <p>Bending with the wind is crucial to
      surviving the winds of change, including
      those involved in caregiving. At times, both
      you and the care receiver may feel a loss
      of control over your lives. While feeling in control is important, sometimes it can
      be me a problem because the more we try
      to control, the less control we seem to have.
      Being flexible can help us keep a positive
      attitude, despite hardships.</p>
    <p>Use the following guidelines to look at
      your situation and to determine what can
      and cannot be changed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Accept the reality of your caregiving
        situation. </li>
      <li> Educate yourself about the care receiver's
        disease. </li>
      <li> Identify unrealistic expectations,
        especially your own.</li>
      <li> Seek and accept support. </li>
      <li> Identify what you still have, rather than
        focus on what is lost. </li>
      <li> Let go of what cannot be changed. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="subheader">Accept the reality
      of your caregiving situation</p>
    <p>When making changes it is necessary, but
      not always easy; to accept reality. We often
      deny things that hurt, and that can keep us
      from seeing a situation as it really is.  Jane heard the doctor tell Joe that he had a
      serious illness. He also told Joe he would
      need more rest and help with certain daily
      activities. Still, Jane found herself feeling
      annoyed when Joe took frequent naps,
      especially since she was taking on more
      responsibility for managing things at home.
      It took time for Jane to stop denying, and
      start accepting, the full impact of the
      disease. It was then that she was able to
      see realistically what could and couldn't
      be changed.</p>
    <p>Jane is coping in a more adaptive way.
      However, Joe's mother denied the seriousness
      of the disease long after Jane came to
      terms with it. Family members may take
      different lengths of time to accept reality,
      which can add to the stress of caregiving.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Educate yourself about
      the care receiver's disease</p>
    <p>You will be better able to identify what
      you can and cannot change when you
      understand the disease. For example, without
      knowledge about the communication
      abilities of someone with Alzheimer's
      disease, you may try to reason with the
      person or expect him to tell someone
      something you consider easy to remember.
      This will probably frustrate both of you.
      There are many sources of information
      about specific diseases, including your
      personal physician, medical libraries, and
      associations related to specific diseases,
      such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
      If you have access to a computer that is
      linked to the Internet, you can find a wealth
      of current information on diseases and
      disease-related associations.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Identify unrealistic expectations,
      especially your own</p>
    <p>You can make changes successfully only
      when your expectations are realistic. How
      realistic are yours? Do you often feel
      anxious because you expect more of yourself
      than you can achieve? Many caregivers
      listen only to the 'shoulds' they have
      been raised with. Women, especially, often
      believe they "should" be able to do
      everything themselves, and when that isn't
      possible, they feel guilty or depressed. If
      you have unrealistic expectations of yourself,
      then your expectations of what can be
      changed probably will be unrealistic also.
      The following story is an example of a
      caregiver, Rosa, who with her husband,
      Dean, made constructive changes in what
      was a difficult, stressful situation.</p>
    <p>Rosa was devastated when Dean, her
      husband of 40 years, suffered a sudden,
      severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed
      on one side of his body and unable
      to speak. The stroke was a shock. .Rosa's
      initial response was to become overly
      protective and do everything for Dean.
      She was afraid to leave him alone for fear
      something terrible would happen.
      Before the stroke, Rosa and Dean had been
      making retirement plans, which included
      extensive travel. Those plans were forsaken
      as they both felt increasingly overwhelmed,
      fearful, isolated, and depressed.
      Rosa became extremely fatigued and irritable
      as Dean became increasingly dependent
      on her. The visiting nurse talked with
      them about what Dean could and could
      not do for himself. She emphasized the
      importance of Dean maintaining as much
      independence as possible. It became
      apparent that Dean could do many things
      for himself, including writing letters to
      family and friends. Dean felt better as he
      became more independent. Rosa was able
      to be more realistic in her expectations.
      She realized that Dean's dependence on her
      was detrimental to their relationship.</p>
    <p>As Rosa and Dean gradually adapted to
      living with the stroke, they became less
      fearful and more hopeful. They began
      looking at the quality of their remaining
      life together. They wanted, more than
      anything, to travel together and decided
      to take a short trip to see how it would go.
      The first trip was successful and they felt
      encouraged to travel more. Rosa found a
      travel agent who helped them plan trips
      that accommodated Dean's disabilities.
      They enjoyed several trips before Dean's
      death 12 years later.
      Rosa and Dean responded to this
      challenge by gaining an understanding of
      the disease, accepting reality; setting
      realistic expectations, and changing what
      could be changed.</p>
    <p class="subheader"> Seek and accept support</p>
    <p>Many caregivers find it difficult to ask
      for help. Rosa initially refused help from
      friends and neighbors. She did everything
      herself until she started feeling distressed.
      The expectations she had for herself were
      overwhelming and unrealistic. It wasn't
      until she began seeking support from the
      visiting nurse, travel agent, and others that
      she was able to find a way to make changes.
      Often you can make changes only with the
      help of others. Seeking and accepting
      support may be the single most important
      factor in making constructive changes.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Identify what you still have,
      rather than focus on what is lost</p>
    <p>When Rosa and Dean decided to look
      for "what remained" in their situation, they
      hoped that they still had quality in their life
      together. They looked at what they still had,
      rather than focusing on what had been lost,
      and they made changes that were still
      possible.</p>
    <p>They found an unexpected 'gift' as they
      made changes and adapted to the illness.
      Rosa said, 'I never would have asked for
      the stroke to happen, but it was because of
      it that Dean and I learned what love was all about. I am a different person than I was.
      I am more understanding, patient, caring,
      and sensitive to the pain of others. Many caregivers, as they learn more
      about themselves, experience personal growth.   
      That is the 'gift' that can often be found 
      in difficult times.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Let go of what cannot be changed</p>
    <p>It is natural to want to hold on to things
      as they were. But letting go of what you
      cannot change is accepting the situation as
      it is. It releases you from the need to control
      what you cannot change. Letting go is a way
      to cooperate with the inevitable. It releases
      new energy for accepting reality and seeing
      new possibilities. Sam is a prime example of
      someone who is learning to let go.</p>
    <p>Sam had always been an intense athletic
      competitor, and sports had been the
      driving force in his life. At age 45 he had a
      slight stroke which left him mildly
      affected. Sam's problem wasn't that he had
      a stroke; the problem was that he couldn't
      let go of wishing that he hadn't had one.
      He continuously wanted things to be as
      they had been. This made him feel angry
      and frustrated. Fortunately, Sam reached
      a point of wanting to learn to live with the
      stroke and to let go of wanting life to be as
      it had been before.</p>
    <p>Sam was unable to live in the present
      until he let go of his desire for things to
      be as they were. The "if onlys" and "what
      ifs" were a source of suffering. When Sam
      let go, he learned to live with the stroke
      and made changes that helped him develop
      a satisfying life. What Sam learned also
      applies to caregivers, as shown in the case
      of Marsha and Bud.</p>
    <p>Marsha was the caregiver for her husband,
      Bud, who had Parkinson's disease. Buds
      condition worsened and he and Marsha
      were unable to do any of the things they
      had done in the past. Marsha continually
      wanted things to be the way they had been.
      "If only" became her constant thought: "If
      only Bud could dress himself," "If only we
      could go dancing like we used to," "If only
      Bud had more energy," "If only he could
      still drive us places."
      Marsha's unhappiness caused a strain
      in their relationship. It was only when
      she and Bud were having a good time
      playing cards with friends one day that she
      realized how much valuable time she was
      wasting by constantly wanting things to
      be different. She began to let go of "if only"
      and to accept "what is." In letting go, she
      found acceptance and peace of mind.</p>
    <p class="blog">As you reflect on your challenges as a
      caregiver, consider these questions. What
      can I change?
      What must I
      accept? What
      can I improve?</p>
    <p class="subheader">Step 4: Take Action
      to Manage Your Stress</p>
    <p>The fourth step points the way for you to
      manage and reduce your stress. There are
      many different tools for managing stress.
      But you must find what is most effective
      for you. Proven ways to manage and reduce
      stress include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>managing your thoughts, beliefs, and
        perceptions. </li>
      <li>practicing self-care. </li>
      <li>getting social support. </li>
      <li> using techniques that lower stress. </li>
      <li>developing plans of action. </li>
      <li>finding hope and meaning. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Managing your thoughts,
      beliefs, and perceptions</p>
    <p>Thoughts and beliefs are the foundation
      of experience. They are not only reactions
      to events but our thoughts and beliefs can
      also influence events. What we think and
      believe affects what happens. Managing our
      thoughts means we have control over how
      we view things. As a caregiver, there may be
      times when the only thing you can change
      is how you view a situation.
      There are several tools for managing
      thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions. Two that
      can be helpful are reframing and self-talk.</p>
    <p>Reframing -</p>
    <p>Your frame of reference is the
      window through which you view the world.
      It gives meaning to your world. You see
      things one way, but someone else sees the
      same circumstances differently. Situations
      become more stressful when you view them
      in a negative way.
      Reframing is learning to look at things in a
      different way, for example, finding something
      positive about a difficult situation. Some
      examples of reframing include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A caregiver who views the behavior of
        someone with Alzheimer's disease as
        "purposefully behaving that way to get
        to me" versus taking the view that "the
        behavior is a part of the disease."</li>
      <li> A caregiver who is angry at her brother
        for helping only once a month versus
        taking the view that "any help, no matter
        how little, will lighten my load." </li>
      <li> A caregiver who puts the situation into
        a religious or philosophical framework,
        such as "This is happening because God
        is angry with me" versus taking the view
        that "God is giving me an opportunity to
        learn and grow."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People who are able to reframe difficult
      situations generally feel less burden and
      more in control. Feeling a greater degree   
      of control often leads to acting in control.
      Clara is a good example. Clara had difficulty taking breaks from
      caregiving. Before becoming a caregiver,
      she had worked in a demanding position
      and had realized the importance of taking
      weekends off and vacations to refresh herself
      and cope better with work demands.
      When she started to view caregiving as
      a job, it made a difference in how she
      viewed breaks in caregiving. They became
      not only more acceptable, but a necessity.</p>
    <p>Julie also found that reframing a difficult
      situation reduced her stress and helped her
      act in new ways. Julie felt resentful and burdened with
      the increasing demands of caring for her
      mother. She had no help, feeling that as a
      good, dutiful daughter she should do it all.
      A social worker told her about available
      resources and suggested she think of
      herself as a personal care manager as a way
      to find help in caregiving. Julie gained a
      sense of control over the situation once she
      realized she didn't have to provide all of
      the care herself, but could oversee her
      mother's care.</p>
    <p>As a caregiver, you may feel overwhelmed
      and burned out, especially if you are assuming
      responsibility for most of the caregiving.
      Changing your perception of your role
      from a caregiver to care manager is a way of
      reframing. As a care manager you still get
      the job done, but you don't have to provide
      all the care yourself. The role of care
      manager means that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>coordinate and supervise another's care
        needs. This includes using available
        support.</li>
      <li>are aware of available community
        resources.</li>
      <li> plan and prioritize care. </li>
      <li>understand the disease of the care receiver
        and what to expect. </li>
      <li> participate as an equal partner with other
        health care professionals. </li>
      <li> are knowledgeable about the health care
        system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a care manager you assume an active
      role and reach beyond giving hands-on
      care, to planning and coordinating care and
      using available resources. You will feel an
      increased sense of mastery as a successful
      care manager.</p>
    <p>Self-talk -</p>
    <p>Most stress management courses
      include learning how to use self-talk to
      .promote health. Self-talk is what we say to
      ourselves. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said,
      "A man is what he thinks about all day long."
      What do you think about all day long?
      What do you say to yourself? I's especially
      important to notice your self-talk when you
      suffer setbacks and when you feel anxious,
      angry; discouraged, or distressed. Negative
      self-talk statements often begin with the
      following phrases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> I just can't do ...</li>
      <li> If only I could (or didn't) do ... </li>
      <li> I could never. .. </li>
      <li> I shouldn't have done ... </li>
      <li> I should have ... </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Negative self-talk is defeating. It can lead
      to depression and a sense of failure, because
      with negative self-talk we tend to focus on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> what we did not do versus what we have
        done. </li>
      <li>what we cant do versus what we can do. </li>
      <li>Our mistakes and failures versus our
        successes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You want your self-talk to work for you,
      not against you. If your self-talk is negative
      or unhelpful, challenge it. Learn to change
      the negative things you say to yourself into
      positive statements, such as affirmations.</p>
    <p>Affirmations are positive, supportive
      statements that counteract the effects of
      negative thinking. When positive statements
      are repeated several times a day, they begin
      to replace negative thoughts. This helps to
      change one's attitude, promote relaxation,
      and reduce stress. Karen's story is an example
      of changing negative self-talk to positive
      self-talk with the use of affirmations:</p>
    <p>Karen felt angry and discouraged when
      her mother didn't eat the tasty, nutritious
      meals she prepared for her. She didn't
      accept the fact that her mother's lack of
      appetite was caused by the illness. Karen
      constantly told herself, "No matter what I
      cook, it is never good enough for mother."</p>
    <p>This is an example of negative self-talk.
      Karen became aware that she often thought
      she was not doing good enough, especially
      in caring for her mother. These thoughts
      made her feel like a failure.
      With determination, patience, and practice,
      you can change your self-talk from
      negative to positive. The following steps
      lead to change:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify your negative thoughts. Listen
        to what you say to yourself, especially
        during difficult times.</li>
      <li> Write your negative thoughts down on
        paper. This helps to identify and clarify
        them.</li>
      <li>Challenge your negative thoughts. Give
        them a good argument.</li>
      <li> Write a simple, positive statement for
        each thought you want to change. </li>
      <li> Memorize and repeat the chosen statements.
        This helps establish the habit of
        positive self-talk. </li>
      <li> Put your written-statements where you
        see them frequently. This is a helpful
        visual reminder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Karen chose the affirmation , "I am
      preparing nutritious food. That is enough."
      In fact, the statements, "I am doing my best.
      It is good enough," became her frequent
      affirmation and counteracted her negative
      thoughts of "not doing good enough."</p>
    <p>These statements have the dual. purpose of
      affirming what Karen is doing and helping
      her let go of the idea that she has control
      over her mother's appetite. Accepting that
      . was important. Telling herself that she is
      doing her best and it is enough is a positive
      way of saying she is changing what she can
      and letting go of what she cannot change.
      Karen's expectations for herself have
      become more realistic.</p>
    <p>Practice over time will change negative,
      habitual thinking. Repeat this activity
      frequently to identify other negative self-talk
      Remember, thoughts and attitudes
      create your reality. Changing your negative
      thoughts will help you focus on the positive
      things in your life, rather than on what you
      don't have.</p>
    <p class="blog">CHALLENGING YOUR SELF-TALK</p>
    <p class="blog">Identify an example of your negative self-talk and the situation when it is most likely to occur.
      Be as clear and as detailed as possible. Post it on the Forum:</p>
    <p class="blog">1. My negative statement: </p>
    <p class="blog"> 2. I say this to myself when: </p>
    <p class="blog">3. I will replace the negative thought with this
      positive statement: </p>
    <p class="blog">4. Repeat the chosen affirmation whenever the
      above situation occurs.</p>
    <p>There will be times when you will find it
      hard to shake off negative thoughts. This is
      normal. However, paying attention to the
      frequency and content of these thoughts
      is the beginning of self-awareness and the
      possibility of change.</p>
    <p>Practicing self-care -</p>
    <p>To be an effective caregiver you need to
      maintain your own health and spirit, and
      to nurture yourself. All too often caregivers
      put their own needs last. Studies show
      that sacrificing yourself in giving care to
      another can lead to emotional exhaustion,
      depression, and illness.</p>
    <p>Maintaining your health and spirit can
      reduce your level of stress. It is critical to
      find activities that help you to stay healthy
      and nurture yourself. These activities are
      different for each individual. What works
      for one person may not work for another.
      You must find stress-reducing methods that
      work best for you.</p>
    <p>We can learn a lot from a self-care
      program in Florida called "Getting Well."
      This is a group of people who are supporting
      each other in learning to live and feel better.
      They take part in life-affirming activities
      such as "laughing, juggling, playing, meditating,
      painting, journal writing, exercising,
      and eating nutritiously" They demonstrate
      the necessity of associating with others who
      help you maintain your spirit and help you
      feel loved and supported.
      To manage stress, it is essential to take
      breaks from caregiving. Plan them into your
      schedule, starting immediately; if you have
      not done so already. Studies show that caregivers
      often don't take breaks until they are
      at the "end of their rope" or "burned out."</p>
    <p>This serves no one's best interest as your
      ability to function can be seriously affected.
      To avoid problems, it is your responsibility
      to take time off from caregiving to refresh
      yourself.
      It is important to the well-being of care
      receivers that you take breaks. If you don't,
      they may become increasingly dependent
      on you. If you take breaks, they will be less
      isolated and will benefit from having contact
      with other people. They also need breaks
      from you. (This is an example of reframing
      your perception of a situation.)</p>
    <p>You are responsible for your own self-care.
      Practicing self-care means that you: </p>
    <ul>

    <p>Reflect on what it means to practice selfcare.
      Consider the items above. How do
      you fare? Are you caring for yourself as well
      as you are caring for another? Remember, it
      is only when we love and nurture ourselves
      that we are able to love and nurture another.
      As a caregiver, appreciation and "thank
      yous" for what you do may be lacking.
      For example, a person with Alzheimer's
      disease may be unable to show appreciation
      for what is done. Everyone has a need for
      approval. It motivates us to keep going. If
      you don't receive appreciation from other
      people, find a way to give it to yourself.</p>
    <p>What would be helpful for you? Consider
      the following suggestions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Acknowledge and take satisfaction in
        those things you do well. </li>
      <li> Reward yourself on a regular basis. </li>
      <li> Involve yourself in an activity that will
        provide positive feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Carol found a creative way to reward
      herself for a job well done when her mother
      could no longer express appreciation. Carol's mother, Irene, had Alzheimer's disease. Irene often expressed frustration
      and anger at Carol, in spite of the fact that
      Carol was her mainstay Carol understood
      the disease process and successfully avoided
      taking her mother's attacks personally. To
      give herself a gift of appreciation, Carol
      bought flowers regularly. She said, "I
      considered the flowers a gift from Mom to
      me. It's something she would have done
      for me if she were well."</p>
    <p>Memories of past generosity and love from
      her mother sustained Carol. In buying herself
      flowers she reminded herself weekly
      that the gift of love and caring she gave to
      her mother had first been given to her. At
      a difficult time she found a way to nurture
      herself.</p>
    <p>What are you doing to
      nurture yourself? Are you
      choosing healthy activities?
      Or are you relying on
      drugs, alcohol, cigarettes,
      and tranquilizers to handle
      the emotional and physical
      burdens of caregiving?
      According to the National
      Institute on Drug Abuse,
      millions of people abuse
      these drugs to reduce
      tension and to relax. It is in
      your best interest to choose
      healthy, nurturing ways of
      coping with the difficulties
      of caregiving.</p>
    <p>Getting social support -</p>
    <p>Caregiving can be a lonely experience.
      According to the National Family
      Caregivers Association, caregivers often ·
      report that they feel alone and isolated.
      Support from family, friends, and others
      is an important stress buffer. Something as
      simple as a two-minute telephone call can
      make you feel cared about and supported.
      It helps to share your experiences and
      burdens with a person you trust-a friend,
      family member, counselor, religious advisor,
      or support group member-who will listen
      and understand.</p>
    <p>Support groups can be helpful when
      you're going through a difficult time.
      Sharing with others who are going through
      similar experiences is a way to give and
      receive support, and take time out from
      caregiving duties. You
      can learn new ways of
      coping from others in the
      group, which may include
      learning to look at the
      light side of difficult
      situations with a bit of
      humor. Sharing lightens
      the load. A support group
      is a place to express
      thoughts and feelings in a
      confidential setting. Most
      important, you learn that
      you are not alone. This
      can be a wonderful relief.
      Support groups are
      available for caregivers
      and for people with various chronic
      illnesses. Local hospitals and disease-related
      associations often have groups available.</p>
    <p>Using techniques that lower stress -</p>
    <p>It is of little help to identify your stressors
      if you don't take action early to reduce
      them. Recognize obstacles to taking action.
      These may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Not giving yourself permission to take
        care of yourself. </li>
      <li> Lacking awareness of stress-reduction
        techniques. </li>
      <li> Choosing unrealistic stress-reduction
        techniques for example, those that are
        too complicated, lengthy, or difficult for
        you. </li>
      <li> Delaying or postponing a stress-reduction
        activity. For example, planning a break or
        trip too far into the future to be of help
        now, when you need it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Take care of yourself daily Use "tried and true" stress reduction tools that work
      for you. In addition, learn and incorporate
      new stress-reducing techniques into your
      life. There are many worthwhile techniques
      available. We offer some quick and easy
      ones that you can fit into your busy life.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Proper diet, adequate sleep, and regular
      exercise are necessary for all of us, and even
      more so when we are caregivers. These
      lifestyle factors increase our resistance to
      illness and our ability to cope with stressful
      situations.</p>
    <p>Exercise promotes better sleep, reduces
      tension and depression, and increases
      energy and alertness. If finding time to
      exercise is a problem, try to incorporate
      it into your usual day Perhaps the person
      receiving care can walk or do stretching
      exercises with you. If necessary do frequent
      short exercises instead of using large blocks
      of time. Find activities you enjoy.
      Walking is considered one of the best and
      easiest exercises. It helps to reduce psychological
      tension as well as having physical
      benefits. </p>
    <p>Walking 20 minutes a day, three
      times a week, is very beneficial. If you can't
      be away 20 minutes, 10-minute walks twice
      a day or even a five-minute walk are
      beneficial.
      Work walking into your life. Walk
      whenever and wherever you can. Perhaps
      it is easiest to walk around your block, at
      the mall, or a nearby park. The next time a
      friend or family member comes to visit, take
      time for a short walk. When the care
      receiver is getting therapy, take a walk
      around the medical facility.</p>
    <p>Breathing for relaxation -</p>
    <p>Stressful
      situations or memories of those situations
      can cause changes in our breathing. Often
      the more tense we feel, the more shallow
      our breathing becomes. · Stress management tools usually include
      a focus on breathing. The following
      breathing exercise takes only one or two
      minutes and you can easily do it anywhere.
      Use it often to lower stress.</p>
    <p>Meditation -</p>
    <p>The word "meditation"
      comes from the Sanskrit word medha which,
      when taken literally, means "doing the
      wisdom." Meditation aids in relaxation and
      in achieving physical and mental well-being.
      Meditation is
      keeping your
      attention focused in
      the moment to
      quiet the mind and
      hear your body's
      inner wisdom. You,
      too, can learn to
      meditate. See the
      "Process of
      Meditation" box on the next page.</p>
    <p>Music -</p>
    <p>Music is another tool for reducing
      stress. It can alter the body and the mind.
      It can induce deep relaxation, act as a
      stimulant, and take you into other states
      of consciousness. Music is often used
      specifically for healing and decreasing stress
      and tension. Use the following steps as a
      guideline. </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Choose soothing music you like.</li>
      <li> Relax and close your eyes. </li>
      <li> Breathe deeply and easily. </li>
      <li> Lose yourself in the music, listening with
        your body, not your mind. </li>
      <li> After the music is finished, open your
        eyes and notice how you feel. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Music is a universal language. Listening
      to music can be healing for both you and
      the care receiver, either together or alone.
      People with dementia, especially, respond to
      music when they may respond to little else.</p>
    <p>Humor -</p>
    <p> Caregivers who maintain and
      foster their sense of humor do better. It is
      , often hard to find much that is humorous
      in caregiving, but the secret to succeeding
      as a caregiver is to find humor in your daily
      routine. Finding humor does not deny the
      fact that, at times, your heart is heavy with
      the pain and sadness of caregiving. Those
      times will exist, but they can co-exist with
      laughter and humor.</p>
    <p>Tears and laughter are closely related.
      They each offer a release of tension and are
      often intermingled. Humor does not
      minimize the seriousness of a situation;
      rather, it helps you embrace it.
      Humor can be a helpful tool in many
      ways, from making us laugh at our
      shortcomings and impossible situations,
      reducing anxiety and stress. Laughter
      relaxes and helps calm emotions, allowing
      us to regain emotional balance and think
      more clearly. If you want to laugh, or want
      someone else to laugh, you may have to
      find a reason, as George and Alma do.</p>
    <p> George and Alma watch their favorite
      comedy show on television every weeknight
      at 7 P.M. They look forward to it and
      anticipate laughing together. In addition,
      Alma and George look for humorous cartoons
      and jokes to share with each other.
      The fact that Alma has a disabling medical
      condition doesn't mean they can't appreciate
      laughter.</p>
    <p>In his book Anatomy of an Illness, Norman
      Cousins wrote of his fight against a crippling
      disease. He credited his recovery to the
      use of laughter. He intentionally sought
      healing through watching videotapes of
      comedies, reading joke books, and listening
      to people tell jokes. He had read about the
      effects of stress and emotions on illness.
      He understood that disease was caused by
      chemical changes in the body, due to the
      stress of strong emotions such as fear and
      anger. He concluded that perhaps love,
      laughter, hope, and the will to live would
      counteract those effects. He was right in his belief. Recent studies show that laughter
      helps to stimulate breathing, muscular
      activity; and heart rate. This serves to reduce
      stress and strengthen the immune system.</p>
    <p>Humor is important to health. It lifts the
      spirit and provides a way to connect with
      others. The following suggestions can help
      · you make laughter and humor a larger part
      of your life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Seek out humor. Humorous tapes and
        books can be found at video stores and
        libraries. Spend time with friends or family
        members you enjoy and can laugh with. </li>
      <li> Surround yourself with humor. Put jokes,
        cartoons, funny pictures, and humorous
        sayings on the refrigerator or bulletin board
        where others can enjoy them with you. </li>
      <li> Laugh at yourself. Don't take yourself
        too seriously Poke fun at yourself by
        making light of your shortcomings
        (which we all have).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Developing action plans -</p>
    <p>Action plans are tools for change. They can be a useful way to identify and plan specific activities for reducing stress and making change: Feelings of accomplishment are necessary for thriving as a caregiver. Action plans can help you achieve these feelings. Even the smallest action can make a big difference. This was true for Evelyn.</p>
    <p>Evelyn needed more time for herself during the day She made a plan to take a leisurely; warm tub bath four times a week instead of the always-hurried shower. Evelyn settled her father to watch the news on TV when she took her baths. This worked well for both of them and became an accepted part of their routine. Accomplishing the action plan encouraged Evelyn to make other action plans that made a big difference to her. </p>
    <p> Feelings of mastery and confidence are usually the result of developing new ways of coping. Use the information presented in this chapter to help you identify your stressors, and improve coping skills. The activity in the box on the next page can be a useful tool for managing stress.
      This activity can be useful on a regular basis. It will help you assess and cope with current stressors. Since your caregiving situation and stressors continually change, it is important to be aware of when you feel stress and to use stress-reducing tools that work for you. Most important, build stress reduction and nurturing activities into daily life to prevent distress. Be proactive and remember, what is good for you is good for the person receiving care!</p>
    <p>Finding hope and meaning -</p>
    <p>The ability to find hope and meaning in
      the caregiving situation enables you not
      only to survive, but to thrive. Finding meaning
      and hope are what keeps us going. It is a
      way to make sense of our circumstances.</p>
    <p> In his book Mans Search For Meaning,
      psychiatrist Viktor Frankl tells of his
      experience as a long-time prisoner in a
      prisoner of war camp during World War II.
      Many of his family members died in the
      camps. In spite of the fact that he faced death constantly and suffered severe
      punishment, Dr. Frankl was able to find
      meaning and hope in his life. He noted that
      the prisoners who were able to sustain even
      a flicker of hope were better able to survive
      the terrible circumstances than those who
      felt hopeless. He concluded that what did
      remain, when all else was taken away; was
      "the last of the human freedoms," the ability
      to "choose one's attitude in a given set of
      circumstances." Out of that experience,
      Frankl's guiding philosophy was born: "To
      live is to suffer, to survive is to find
      meaning in the suffering." He also believed
      that man's need for meaning is universal.</p>
    <p>The need to find hope and meaning is
      also important when you are a caregiver
      for a person with
      a chronic illness.
      Uncertainty; loss, and
      suffering may shake
      your foundation.
      After all, you have
      much at stake. Your
      world, as you have known it, has changed
      drastically and you may be left with
      questions such as, "Why me?" and perhaps,
      "Where is God?" Questioning often leads to
      a search for meaning. No one else can tell
      you what the meaning is for you. It can be a
      lonely journey.</p>
    <p class="blog">REFRAMING YOUR STRESS</p>
    <p class="blog">Make a list of those things that you find most
      difficult or stressful. Be specific. Write at least
      two (more if you can).</p>
    <p class="blog"> Answer the following questions in relation to
      each item on your list.
      Can I ignore this? Or can I let it go?</p>
    <p class="blog">Can I change anything about this? If so, how can I change it?</p>
    <p class="blog"> If it can't be changed, can I change my perception of it? If so, how? What is a more helpful perception?</p>
    <p class="blog"> Select one stressor from your list to work on
      first. The stressor is: Develop an action plan for addressing this stressor. Be specific and realistic.</p>
    <p>A search for meaning can be a conscious choice. There are ways to stimulate your search. The following can be helpful:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask yourself questions like "What am I to learn from this?" What good can come from this? Am I a better person now? These types of questions can help you open up to possibilities for finding meaning.</li>
      <li> Reflect .. Periods of quiet reflection, especially after a difficult time, are important and offer opportunities to learn from the experience.</li>
      <li>Talk with a trusted person. Whether this person is a counselor, religious advisor, or friend, sharing can help clarify your thoughts and feelings. As you tell
        your story; it often takes on meaning.</li>
      <li>Write. This is also a way to clarify your thinking. Writing is a way to bring out your thoughts and feelings. Write freely and spontaneously. Don't concern yourself with proper sentence structure or punctuation. Writing is a way to talk to yourself. Re-reading your journal over time provides an understanding of where you were when you started and where you are now. You will probably see changes and find new 
        understanding and meaning.</li>
      <li>Seek spiritual renewal. This is especially important when you are facing difficult times. Many caregivers report that faith and prayer help them find comfort, purpose, and meaning. It may be that even when you feel anger because of suffering and sorrow, your need for meaning is greatest.</li>

    <p>Like Frankl, it is hopeful to believe that meaning can be found in difficult and painful experiences. Hope and meaning play a large part in the following story of Margaret and Tim.</p>
    <p>Tim's frequent visits to his elderly mother, Margaret, in the nursing home, were meaningful to him. Years ago, when Margaret was healthy; she shared some of her beliefs with Tim. She had told him, "If there comes a time when I am not able to recognize you because of Alzheimer's disease, or for any other reason, I want you to know what I believe to be true. I believe that my true essence, my spirit, will always be present, even though my physical body and mind may not be the person you  remember. Please know that I am with you. We may not be able to talk with each other as we did in the past, but if you play my favorite music, read poetry, hold my hand, or just be with me, I will feel your love and you will feel mine for you."</p>
    <p>In sharing her beliefs, Margaret gave Tim the gift of finding meaning in what can be a most difficult and challenging situation. Meaning is all around us. It is the "stuff'' of life. Meaning is personal. It is up to each
      persc1n to find his or her own meaning.</p>
    <p class="subheader">SUMMARY</p>

Do you realize the potential strength in considering your needs and in practicing self-care? Can you find meaning in difficult experiences? Have you learned that often the compassion and care you give to another comes back to you as a gift of meaning?</p>
    <p>Remember that your response to a situation will affect the situation itself. As much as possible, make it be what you want it to be.</p>
