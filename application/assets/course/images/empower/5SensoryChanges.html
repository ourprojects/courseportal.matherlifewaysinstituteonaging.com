
<p> As we all discover in time, aging. is an
  individual journey. The variations
  are almost as great as the number
  of us who make the trip. Despite the
  uniqueness of our paths, there are some
  commonalities we share along the way. In the physical realm, there is the
  gradual loss of muscle mass, bone density
  and heart and lung capacity, for instance.
  Reaction time slows. While staying active
  and physically fit is possible, and certainly
  beneficial, doing so is a bit more of a chore
  than it was in younger years.
  Research into the psychological impact
  of aging has led to mixed findings. Short-term
  memory abilities seem to show areas of slight decline, while long-term memory
  seems less affected, if at all. Our ability to
  use language seems to get better, assuming
  overall good health, as both our vocabulary
  and word fluency improve. When it comes to aging, little, if anything
  remains exactly as it has been. So it is with
  our senses-vision, hearing, touch, smell,
  and taste.</p>
<p><strong>SENSORY GOOD NEWS/BAD NEW</strong><br />
  Each of our sensory capabilities -
  detection, recognition and discrimination·
  declines with age. But there is some good
  news. For starters, most individuals have
  more than enough sensory capacity and capability to last them throughout their lives,
  no matter how old they live to be. Some
  may notice little or no decline. Additionally,
  changes to sensory ability most often occur
  gradually, which allows for successful
  accommodation to the change. Furthermore,
  at least for many, there is the opportunity to
  aid change or loss via corrective lenses,
  hearing aids, dietary adjustments, etc. </p>

<p><strong>WHY SENSORY CHANGES MATTER</strong><br />
  One goal of good caregiving is helping
  the care receiver stay engaged with the
  world in as meaningful a way as possible.
  Sensitivity to these changes improves the
  chances of better interaction. Given the
  role senses play in our lives, change can
  affect both the care receiver as well as those
  around her or him. Senses connect us to the
  outside world. Being aware of age-related
  sensory changes allows one to accommodate
  them and minimize loss.</p>
<p><strong>How Sensory Changes Affect Lives</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Reduce ability to communicate and interact</li>
  <li> Decrease mobility and freedom</li>
  <li> Increase dependence on others </li>
  <li> Alter perception, and response to
    environment</li>
  <li> Lead to social isolation and deprivation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMMON AGE-RELATED
  SENSORY CHANGES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vision Changes</strong><br />
  The most recognized age-related vision
  change is presbyopia, or farsightedness,
  which is caused by the gradual loss of flexibility
  of the eye's lens, and results in a
  decline in the ability to focus on small
  objects. This change usually occurs between
  ages 40 and 55. Presbyopia is a normal
  condition, not a disease, and usually can
  be corrected with reading glasses or other
  corrective lenses.</p>
<p><strong><img src="http://onlineportal.matherlifeways.com/file.php?file=/8/iStock_000003566890Large.jpg" alt="image" width="450" height="294" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></strong>Another normal change is the reduction in peripheral vision the
  size of the perceived visual field gets
  smaller. This can be dramatic, decreasing
  from 250 degrees or more to as little as
  120 degrees. An older person may not notice a pedestrian, a bicyclist, or a car
  approaching from the side the way he or she might have in the past.
  Additionally, there is a marked decline
  . in convergence between the eyes. This
  means the eyes are not able to focus
  together, making it more difficult to judge
  distance and depth. This is particularly
  problematic in low-lighting situations.</p>
<p>Light is also an issue with other changes
  older persons will likely experience. One
  is the slowing of the eye's adaptation to
  changes in light, which is particularly
  noticeable after age 70. Going from a
  lighted room to a darkened one, or vice
  versa (think about a movie theater, or a
  midnight trip to the bathroom), or moving
  into and out of shadows (walking along the
  sidewalk on a sunny day) can be troublesome
  for the older person if not given
  ample time to adjust. Glare becomes an
  increasing problem, as does an increased
  light threshold, or the need for more
  intense and direct lighting.</p>
<p>There is also increasing difficulty in color
  discrimination, especially at the cool end
  of the light spectrum-violet, blue and
  green. For an older person, distinguishing
  differences between darkish greens, blues
  and black is difficult, and interferes with
  color coordinating clothing or seeing the
  edge of the step at the top of the stairway.
  (Hence, the yellow tape on the edges of
  steps in public places.)</p>
<p><strong>Diseases of the eye</strong><br />
  It is important to realize that not all
  vision changes are age-related or inevitable
  with advancing years. Sadly, many diseases
  can reduce or totally rob one's Sight, and
  their symptoms can be difficult to spot.
  Disease symptoms sometimes mimic the
  age-related changes discussed above, and
  thereby might go unnoticed until much
  damage has been done. Or, a symptom may
  be noticed, but mistakenly chalked up to
  "old age."
  Some eye diseases, such as macular
  degeneration and glaucoma, occur most
  commonly among the elderly. Others, like
  diabetic retinopathy, are the result of an
  existing or chronic condition. Vigilance is
  key, and seeking professional eye care on
  a regular basis is vital, especially for those
  past age 65.</p>
<p><strong>Vision assistance</strong>: what to do
  Many things can be beneficial to those
  with visual limitations. Being aware of
  how the eye changes over time or the
  characteristics of a given disease or condition are good beginnings, providing
  a· base to build on. Being alert to safety
  hazards in and around the home is
  another. Throw rugs, clutter on the floor,
  poorly lit areas (especially stairways) and
  electrical cords lying across a pathway are
  invitations for accidents. Balanced, even
  lighting reduces glare and shadows, making
  distance and depth easier to judge. Paying
  close attention to where light originates
  (windows or lamps), and to highly
  reflective surfaces (floors, woodwork and
  walls, mirrors, table tops, etc.) can help in
  managing glare.</p>
<p>Some additional hints:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Keep corrective lenses clean and handy </li>
  <li> Use large black markers on light
    backgrounds for written instructions </li>
  <li> Keep surroundings predictable and
    relatively free of visual clutter </li>
  <li> Respect the routine of the care receiver,
    and provide a stable routine yourself </li>
  <li> Identify yourself when you enter the
    person's space, and announce when you
    leave </li>
  <li> Where possible, face the visually impaired
    person and speak directly to him or
    her. Not only does it improve verbal
    communication, it is a show of respect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hearing Changes</strong><br />
  Hearing difficulty is one of the most
  common chronic conditions affecting older adults. Technically, hearing loss may begin
  as early as the mid-20s, but most people
  have no noticeable symptoms until much
  later. Approximately one-third of Americans
  older than 60, and as many as half of those
  older than 85, have significant hearing loss.
  Hearing loss can come in many forms
  and has numerous causes. <a href="http://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">The National
  Institutes of Health</a> list two general
  categories of hearing loss- sensorineural
  and conductive.</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Sensorineural hearing</em> loss is the result
    of damage to the inner ear or the auditory
    nerve. This type of loss is permanent.</li>
  <li><em>Conductive hearing</em> loss is caused by
    the inability of sound waves to reach the
    cochlea, a small bone located deep in the
    inner ear. The causes are many, including
    wax build-up, excessive fluid, eardrum
    damage, etc. Many times these conditions
    can be treated and improved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Presbycusis, one form of hearing loss
  commonly associated with increasing age,
  can result from changes to any or all parts
  of the ear. It comes on gradually, generally
  affecting those age 50 or older. Common
  symptoms include a decreased ability to
  hear certain sound frequencies, especially those at the higher end of the frequency
  range, difficulty hearing low intensity
  ('soft') noises, an increased intolerance
  for loud sound, and difficulty hearing
  when there is background sound. Causes
  can include aging, loud noises, genetics,
  circulation problems, head injury, infection
  or medications.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing loss indicators</strong><br />
  The National Institute on Deafness and
  Other Communication Disorders recommends
  a hearing exam for anyone experiencing
  more than a couple of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Difficulty hearing on the phone </li>
  <li> Difficulty hearing with background noise</li>
  <li> Difficulty following conversations when
    more than one person is talking </li>
  <li> Difficulty understanding the speech of
    women or children </li>
  <li> Regularly misunderstanding or
    responding inappropriately </li>
  <li> Regularly asking others to repeat
    themselves </li>
  <li> Experiencing others' speech as mumbling </li>
  <li> Receiving complaints about the high
    volume of TV, radio, or phone</li>
  <li>Straining to hear or understand a
    conversation </li>
  <li> Hearing ringing, roaring, or sounds that
    seem too loud </li>
</ul>
<p>While hearing loss is prevalent in our
  society and particularly so in the older
  community, not all hearing loss is normal,
  unpreventable or untreatable. Seek medical
  attention as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing loss impact</strong><br />
  Helen Keller made this distinction
  between blindness and deafness: blindness
  separates man from things, while deafness
  separates man from man. Few of us are
  more qualified than her to speak on this
  topic, yet many people say that what they
  fear most is losing their sight. Whatever
  ones opinion, no one doubts that loss of
  hearing has a profound impact: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Safety (public and private) may be
    compromised </li>
  <li> Pleasurable activities, such as music,
    travel, or conversation, may lose their
    appeal </li>
  <li> One may receive insensitive treatment in
    social exchanges </li>
  <li> Withdrawal and social isolation may
    result as a way of protecting one's energy
    and self-esteem </li>
  <li> Hearing-impaired people must constantly
    work to find the energy to interact in
    an environment created for, and often
    dependent on, sound </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hearing assistance: what to do</strong><br />
  People with hearing impairment or loss
  should try to surround themselves with
  others who are willing to understand,
  people with whom they can share their
  experiences. As a caregiver for a hearing-impaired
  person, you can bolster your
  care receiver's confidence and self-esteem,
  reduce the everyday stresses accompanying
  hearing loss and help recharge emotional
  batteries when necessary. Tips include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Face the person, making eye contact </li>
  <li> Speak clearly and slightly louder, but do
    not shout</li>
  <li>Limit other noises</li>
  <li> Be prepared to repeat, using simpler
    phrases </li>
  <li> Avoid chewing, smoking, or covering
    your mouth when speaking </li>
  <li> Use expressions and gestures to clue the
    person </li>
  <li> Determine if the person has one ear that
    hears better than the other, and speak to
    that side </li>
  <li> Ask family; friends, and health
    professionals about communication
    techniques to use or avoid </li>
  <li> Ask the listener if any further help is
    needed</li>
  <li> Include the hearing-impaired person in
    conversations about them </li>
  <li> In public settings, choose locations away
    from crowded or noisy areas </li>
  <li> Be patient, positive, and stay relaxed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tactile Changes</strong><br />
  With aging comes a reduction in touch
  sensitivity, so higher thresholds for touch
  sensitivity are needed. This is especially
  true in the fingertips, palms, and lower
  extremities. The ability to distinguish
  touches ("<em>Am I touching one, two or three
  needles?</em>") is lessened, particularly in the
  fingertips. Pain sensitivity also is less for
  external stimuli, and there is a lessening
  of ability to distinguish levels of perceived
  pain, such as discerning the difference
  between a cool object and a very cold
  object). Vibrations are also more difficult
  for older people to detect.</p>
<p>With age the skin becomes thinner, dryer,
  less elastic, less supple and less taut, and
  overall more vulnerable. Damage to the skin that occurs after many years, decreased
  blood flow to the touch receptors, the brain,
  or spinal cord, or nutritional deficiencies
  contribute to these changes. Diseases such
  as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and conditions
  brought on by strokes, arthritis, or
  swelling can exaggerate these tactile losses.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of tactile changes</strong><br />
  When compared to vision and hearing
  loss, tactile changes may appear benign.
  Yet changes in the ability to feel one's way
  in the world are not without an impact.
  Reduced tactile sensitivity places an
  individual at an increased risk of sustaining
  serious injuries, pressure sores, skin ulcers,
  heat stroke, burns and hypothermia. A loss
  of sensitivity may result in not knowing
  how tightly to grasp something or someone,
  cause one to over-react or under-react to
  pain or not be able to effectively manipulate
  tools.</p>
<p>People with diabetes can lose limbs
  because they do not realize they have
  hurt themselves until the wound is out of
  control. Alzheimer's sufferers sometimes
  cannot process pain as they would normally;
  resulting in life-threatening situations.
  Persons who are bedridden or spend large
  amounts of time sitting are at considerable
  risk of developing pressure sores. This
  can be made even more pronounced by
  decreased tactile awareness. In short,
  tactile decline is sign.ificant for many older
  persons, and can be a threat to their safety;
  social and emotional well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Tactile assistance: what to do</strong><br />
  Some useful tips to prevent or minimize touch-related problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Be aware that skin thins with aging. Thin
    skin bruises and tears more easily; and
    may take longer to heal </li>
  <li>Pay careful attention to wound prevention
    and care.</li>
  <li>Avoid exposure to extremes of hot or cold. </li>
  <li>Always wear shoes or slippers to protect
    less-sensitive feet. </li>
  <li> Test water with your wrist before using it
    for an older person. </li>
  <li> Blot rather than rub the skin when drying. </li>
  <li> Use moisturizers to help protect older skin. </li>
  <li> Limit the maximum water temperature in
    your house </li>
  <li> Dress for the temperature. Do not wait
    until you become overheated or chilled. </li>
  <li> Inspect skin, especially on the feet,
    regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TASTE AND SMELL CHANGES</strong><br />
  Taste and smell are separate and distinct,
  but they often work together. Sometimes,
  a problem with one may be mistaken as
  a problem with the other. Taste and smell
  can give pleasurable sensations or warn a
  person of danger. They play an important
  role in the acceptance and enjoyment of
  food. And though they are the only two
  senses whose cells are replaced regularly
  throughout life, their sensitivity decreases
  with age just like the other senses.</p>
<p>Taste suffers the least decline of any of
  the senses, but in general older people need
  a higher concentration of sweets to taste
  sweetness, a higher concentration of salt to
  taste saltiness and a lower concentration of
  sour to taste sourness.
  The reasons for these changes are not
  fully understood, and they mayor may not
  be caused by advancing age alone. Possible
  explanations for this decline include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of taste buds
    over time </li>
  <li> Reduced
    production
    of saliva that
    sometimes
    accompanies
    advanced age </li>
  <li> Poor oral hygiene
    and resulting tooth
    decay or mouth
    sores </li>
  <li> Certain drugs
    and medical treatments (such as
    chemotherapy or radiation) </li>
  <li> Poor nutrition</li>
</ul>
<p>Taste contributes to our ability to enjoy
  food. Any problems with taste can have a
  major impact on the lives of those individuals
  affected. When taste is impaired, we may
  eat poorly and socialize less. Loss of taste
  can lead to a loss of appetite, resulting in
  weight loss, reduced immunity, malnutrition,
  and worse. It can also result in eating too
  much of the wrong thing, in an attempt to
  recapture missing tastes (e.g., salt). Taste
  impairment may also make it more difficult
  to figure out if food is suitable to eat.</p>
<p>The olfactory sense-smell-begins a
  significant decline by age 60. By age 80 or
  so, smell sensitivity has likely been reduced
  by about half compared to one's youth. In
  addition to age, many things can affect smell,
  including diseases of the nose, nasal passageways
  or sinuses; neurological diseases; head
  injuries; allergies; and exposure to airborne
  toxic chemicals (cigarette smoke is the most
  common). Medications, medical treatments
  or complications of sinusitis can also affect
  smell sensitivity. As with taste, the loss of smell can have
  a pronounced affect on our enjoyment of
  the world around us. The scents of food
  cooking or flowers in the garden are, for
  many, examples of the essence of a life
  worth living. But there are other aspects to the loss of smell. The sense of smell can
  serve as a warning signal, alerting us to
  smoke from a fire, the odor of a natural gas
  leak or spoiled food. Cooking accidents,
  eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic
  substances and failing to detect gas leaks
  or fires all increase when smell is impaired.
  Loss of smell can also be an early indication
  of a more serious disease or condition such
  as Multiple Sclerosis or a brain tumor.</p>
<p>Those with a loss of smell should take
  extra precautions to ensure their safety and
  health. Be extra careful with food, making
  sure it is not spoiled. Ask someone to help
  in making an assessment, or throw it out
  if you are not certain. Install smoke alarms
  and gas detectors, and change the batteries
  on a regular basis. If you or the care
  receiver has a sudden change in the ability
  to smell, make an appointment with your
  physician.</p>
