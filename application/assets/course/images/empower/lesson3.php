  <h1>Communicating Effectively in Challenging Situations</h1>
  <p>This lesson contains four main sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicating to Take Care of You</li>
    <li>Expressing Yourself Under Special Circumstances</li>
    <li>Challenging Communication Styles</li>
    <li>Setting your Goals and Making Action Plans</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many caregivers say one of their
    biggest challenges involves uttering
    the word <em>No</em>. The feeling is
    that saying no is somehow not permissible.
    If you feel this way, ask yourself: </p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Is there
      courage and nobility
      in saying nothing
      and burning out?</em></li>
    <li><em>Or
      does true courage and
      nobility lie in
      taking care of yourself
      so you can be a caring
      helper longer?</em></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Keep those questions in mind as we
    discuss in this lesson tools for dealing with
    these caregiving challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> setting limits </li>
    <li> asking for help </li>
    <li> expressing and responding to criticism </li>
    <li> expressing anger </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will also discuss how to communicate
    more effectively under special circumstances
    and with people who use the following
    communication styles: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Passive/peacekeeping </li>
    <li> Aggressive/pitbull </li>
    <li> Factual/computer</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Communicating to Take Care of You</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Caregivers frequently report they have
      difficulty setting limits and asking for help.
      Yet, these are critical tools for avoiding
      burnout, maintaining your well-being, and
      getting the support you need. It's equally
      important to express your feelings and give
      criticism in constructive ways. You want
      others to hear what you have to say, not to
      focus on how you said something.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Setting Limits</p>
    <p>If you have never set limits, it can take
      time to feel good about doing so and to
      communicate your limits in positive ways.
      At first people may not take you seriously
      and you might back down a few times.
      But with time and practice, you can do it.
      You might be surprised at your family's
      reaction. Many caregivers discovered that
      their relatives were pleased and relieved
      when they began setting limits. It seems
      family members worried less knowing that
      caregivers were taking care of themselves. B ecause only you know what your limits
      are, setting your limits is up to you. Setting
      limits is a form of self-respect and honesty.
      It's realizing that you can't do everything
      and that's okay. It also shows consideration
      for family and friends. It helps take the
      guesswork out of planning and problem
      solving when you tell others what you are
      able and unable to do.</p>
    <p>Remember, your limits are not engraved
      in stone. You can be flexible and change
      them when your priorities change and
      when time, place, people, and circumstances
      demand it.</p>
    <p>What happens if you don't set limits -</p>
    <p>As a caregiver, do you think setting limits
      is selfish? Do you believe people who set
      limits are uncaring? If so, think about what
      can happen if you don't set limits. Not
      setting limits can lead to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> feelings of resentment on your part.</li>
      <li> caregiver burnout, and possibly, the
        inability to provide the help needed.</li>
      <li> concern by family about your health and
        even your survival. </li>
      <li>health problems related to stress and
        fatigue, or even death.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Limits carry risks -</p>
    <p>Relationships suffer when they are based
      on someone doing whatever another person
      wants or needs. If you lose closeness with a
      person because you set limits, ask yourself,
      "Am I better off without a relationship completely
      defined by what the other person
      wants?" Then weigh the risks, to yourself
      and the care receiver, of not setting limits.
      Think about the serious effects on you and
      the care receiver if your health fails.</p>
    <p>Consider the consequences
      of setting limits -</p>
    <p>Before saying or doing anything about
      setting limits, review possible consequences
      of what you want to do. Ask yourself: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What would be the worst outcome?
        How would I handle it? </li>
      <li>What are the chances the worst outcome
        will happen? Could I live with it? </li>
      <li> What are the consequences if I do
        nothing? Can I live with those? </li>
      <li> What is the best thing that could happen?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some limits are not negotiable -</p>
    <p>Look carefully at limits you cannot  
      exceed. These are your non-negotiable
      limits. What is the most you can give to
      others? This has to be clear, "I am able to
      help two days a week. That is all I can do."</p>
    <p>Look at how you set limits now -</p>
    <p>Evaluate your current style of setting
      limits, particularly with the care receiver and
      other family members. Check the boxes that
      most closely describe how you set limits.</p>

        Do I try setting limits once and then

      <p>
        <input name="Submit" type="submit" id="Submit" onClick="MM_popupMsg('Did you check \'yes\' in answering any  questions? If so, the following suggestions  will help you set and communicate your limits.')" value="Submit">
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Start small -</p>
    <p>If you have trouble setting
      limits, start with people outside your family
      and start with small matters, like telling a
      caller you can visit for only five minutes.</p>
    <p>Start with the easy people -</p>
    <p>This means
      practicing saying a polite, firm "no'' to
      someone either unrelated to you or that you
      don't even know, such as telephone sales
      solicitors, fund-raisers for questionable
      charities, or pollsters in the local mall. A
      simple ~'Thank you for your call, but I
      cannot donate to your cause" (or whatever
      the request is) is all you need to say. If the
      person persists, just keep repeating your
      statement and soon he will give up.</p>
    <p>Start with easy situations -</p>
    <p>It's a good
      idea to warm up on situations or tasks that
      are impersonal or that you don't like. For
      example, if you enjoy volunteering but you
      don't care for the schedule or the assignment,
      try saying, "I enjoy volunteering but
      I must cut back. I'd be glad to help one
      Thursday a month at this time with ... "
      Then work up to family situations, such as
      who will host the holiday dinners.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Communicating your limits</p>
    <p>The following tools will help you communicate
      what you can and cannot do.</p>
    <p> Be clear about your limits -</p>
    <p>Use <em>I</em> statements and be as specific
      about your limits as possible. I <em> am happy
      to stop by after work tonight but I have to
      leave by 6:30.</em> (The formula is: <em>Up to this
      point I can do __ </em>. <em>Beyond this point I
      will do _</em> , or <em>_ happens</em>.)</p>
    <p>Offer choices within your limits -</p>
    <p>This is a way to replace what you can't
      do with a choice of what you can and are
      willing to do. "I can't take you shopping
      today; but I can do it either on Thursday
      afternoon or Saturday morning. Which
      is best for you?" (The formula is: "I am unable to do __ , but I can do __ or
      _· _ .Which do you prefer?"). Sharon said
      to her son:</p>
    <p>I've enjoyed having the grandchildren stay
      at the house over the holidays every year.
      Because Grandpa needs more help these
      days, I can't ask them to stay with us this
      year. I would like to have them over to sing
      carols and decorate Christmas cookies with
      Grandpa. Let's talk during Thanksgiving.</p>
    <p>Make no excuses -</p>
    <p>Giving factual reasons for setting limits
      aids understanding and is different from
      making excuses. Offering excuses sounds
      apologetic. Notice that the following statements
      contain no excuses or self-criticism: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"I'd like to do that, but for now I can only
        handle these three things." (You are being
        factual and specific, and suggesting the
        limits are not permanent ones.) </li>
      <li>"I appreciate your suggestions. Right now
        I can't fit them into my day:" (This is a
        good response to unsolicited advice.) </li>
      <li>"I need some time to think about it. I'll
        let you know tomorrow." (This gives you
        time if you feel like making excuses or if
        flattery or "guilt trips" undermine your
        resolve.) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to make it easier, you can
      prepare people over the phone or in writing
      that you have to rethink how much you can
      do. You also can mention that your doctor
      advises you to cut down.
      Some people may respond negatively
      to your limits. This doesn't mean you are
      wrong. It usually means things are changing
      that other people wish would stay the same.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Asking for Help</p>
    <p>Some caregivers feel that by asking for
      help they are somehow falling short. But
      asking for help may be the only way they
      can continue to provide care at home. They
      are not falling short; they are adapting to
      changing care needs that cannot be met
      without help. It is a caregiver's responsibility
      to ask for help. If you feel uncomfortable
      asking for it, consider the following
      questions about asking for salt.</p>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes8" id="Yes8">
        <label for="Yes8">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No8" id="No8">
        <label for="No8">No  | </label>
        Do you expect people to pass the salt before you ask for it?</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes9" id="Yes9">
        <label for="Yes9">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No9" id="No9">
        <label for="No9">No  | </label>
        Do you blame people for not knowing you want salt?</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes10" id="Yes10">
        <label for="Yes10">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No10" id="No10">
        <label for="No10">No  | </label>
        Would you plead, hint, or whine to get the salt?</p>
      <input type="button" onClick="MM_popupMsg('You probably answered \&quot;no\&quot; to the salt questions. just as we expect to ask for salt in order to receive it, we also need to ask for the help we need in caregiving. As you ask for help, remember to use the tone of voice you use when asking for salt. It\'s probably pleasant and matter-of-fact, without blaming and hinting.')" value="Submit">
    </div>
    <p>Prepare yourself to ask for help -</p>
    <p>Before you ask for help, consider the
      following suggestions.</p>
    <p>Consider the person's special abilities
      and interests - Before approaching someone
      with a request, consider their likes, dislikes,
      areas of interest, experience, abilities, and
      knowledge. For instance, if someone t:HIU'IY
      cooking but dislikes driving, your chances·
      improve if you ask for help with cooking.
      Your chances for success also improve if
      you ask the person to help you with tasks
      he feels comfortable with and knows how
      to do. Tasks unrelated to caregiving are
      easier for some people.
      Note: When one family member has a
      medical or nursing background, it is natural
      to expect that he is the best one to help with
      caregiving. Take care that other relatives are
      not automatically excused from responsibility
      because there is a health professional in
      the family.</p>
    <p>Resist asking the same person repeatedly - Ask yourself if you are requesting help
      from a certain person because he or she has
      difficulty saying no. It is important to capitalize
      on your stronger speaking skills rather
      than on someone else's inability to set limits.</p>
    <p> Consider the person's special needs - Personal, private time is hard to come by.
      As a caregiver, no one knows this better
      than you. Other obligations in people's lives
      may limit the time and energy they have to
      give. Consider these matters before asking
      for help and talk them over. <em>I need more
      help with the . I know you are
      very busy and I'm concerned about asking
      too much of you. Would helping me a few
      hours during the week be more than you
      can do comfortably?</em> Out of concern for
      everyone's needs, you may decide it's time
      Jo inquire about hiring in-home help. </p>
    <p>Decide the best time to make a request - Timing is important. A person who is tired,hungry, stressed, or busy is not a good candid:ate for a request. </p>
    <p>Prepare a list of things that need doing - If you are unsure what people prefer to do,
      relatives say they don't know how to
      help, make a list of tasks you need help
      with (cooking, errands, yard-work, someone  
      to visit with the care receiver) and let
      them choose.
      Some caregivers turn providing help into
      gifts given. The idea is that when people
      give their time and energy to help, they are
      giving the caregiver a valuable gift. They
      may call their list "Gifts of Help" or <em>Gifts
      You Can Share/Give</em>.</p>
    <p>Be prepared for hesitance or refusal - Your request might be answered with a
      simple no or silence. The person may be
      unable or unwilling to help and is setting
      personal limits. Sometimes refusals upset
      caregivers. Realizing the refusal has hurt the
      caregiver's feelings, the person may change
      his mind and decide to help, but the relationship
      will suffer. If the person hesitates, ask,
      "Would you like time to think about it?"</p>
    <p>Suggestions for asking for help - </p>
    <p>The following communication tools may
      help if you feel uncomfortable putting your
      request into words.</p>
    <p>Use your please-pass-the-salt style to
      make requests - This is the tone you want
      to use when you ask someone for help.
      Practice making a request: "I would like to
      go to church on Sunday. Would you mind
      staying with Grandma?" in the same tone
      you would use to ask for the salt.</p>
    <p>Use "I" statements to make clear,
      specific requests - A statement like "I need
      more help" is vague. A specific request
      sounds like, "I would like to go to church
      this Sunday. Would you stay with Grandma
      from 9:00a.m. to noon?"</p>
    <p>Avoid weakening your request - If you
      say "Could you think about staying with
      Grandma?" you weaken your request.
      Saying, "It's only a thought, but I'd like to
      go to church," sounds like your request isn't
      very important to you. Notice the strength
      of the statement, "Would you stay with
      Grandma from 9:00a.m. to noon?"</p>
    <p>Use an "I" statement to express appreciation
      for any help even if it is given reluctantly - "I want to thank you for staying with
      Grandma so I could go to church today."</p>
    <p>If your request is turned down -</p>
    <p>If your request is turned down, try not to
      take it personally and give yourself credit
      for asking. Most likely the person is turning
      down the task, not you. Or he may worry
      about doing the task the way you want
      it done. Consider asking, "Do you have
      any concerns about what I have asked?"
      Then express appreciation for the person's
      willingness to hear your request. "Thank
      you for taking the time to listen."
      Try not to let a refusal prevent you
      from asking for help again. The person
      who refused today may be glad to help
      another time.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Expressing Criticism</p>
    <p>If setting limits and asking for help seems
      risky to caregiving relationships, expressing
      criticism may seem
      even more risky.
      But sometimes
      you must speak up
      whether you want
      to or not. This is
      especially true when health or safety are
      involved. Because the person may not like
      what he hears doesn't mean you shouldn't
      speak up. Usually, how criticism is given
      affects people more than the criticism itself.
      Consider Grace's approach:</p>
    <p>Don't load the dishwasher that way Always
      put the glasses on the upper rack and the
      cups in rows behind the saucers. You're
      wasting detergent. I never use that much.
      How would you feel about loading Grace's
      dishwasher? Was the way you were doing
      it wrong or simply different? Grace could
      use some advice on more effective ways to
      correct people.</p>
    <p>Before offering criticism -</p>
    <p>Constructive criticism helps people learn.
      It focuses on problems, not personalities.
      It shows you care enough to level with the
      person. A courteous, respectful tone makes your words, not your behavior, worth remembering. Before you say anything, reflect on why you are criticizing. Use the following checklist to be certain you are criticizing for
      the right reasons.</p>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes11" id="Yes11">
        <label for="Yes11">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No11" id="No11">
        <label for="No11">No  | </label>
        Are you in a bad mood?</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes12" id="Yes12">
        <label for="Yes12">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No12" id="No12">
        <label for="No12">No  | </label>
        Do you want to appear wiser, more
        knowledgeable or more experienced?</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes13" id="Yes13">
        <label for="Yes13">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No13" id="No13">
        <label for="No13">No  | </label>
        Do you want to punish someone?</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" name="Yes14" id="Yes14">
        <label for="Yes14">Yes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="No14" id="No14">
        <label for="No14">No  | </label>
        Are you criticizing because something is done differently (not wrong or worse) than you do it? </p>
      <input type="button" onClick="MM_popupMsg('Re-evaluate your "yes" responses because
      all are invalid reasons for criticizing. Valid
      reasons include unsafe activities and behavior
      that violates the rights and feelings of
      others. Once you decide your motives are
      valid, think about the timing and possible
      pitfalls before you offer criticism.')" value="Submit">

    <p>Timing is important. If you ignore a problem or
      delay addressing it, you give someone the
      message that he is doing fine. Then when
      you do speak up, the person wonders why
      you didn't say something earlier. Delays in
      addressing the problem may also allow it
      to grow worse and your feelings about it
      to build. This often leads to blaming "you"
      statements like, "Why don't you ever ... ?"
      "You always ... ,1
      ' or "You never ... "</p>
    <p>Avoid the pitfalls - Before you say
      anything, mentally review pitfalls you want
      to avoid. It's important to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> resist offering an opinion about the
        person's motives for doing what he did.</li>
      <li> avoid mind-reading and judging the other
        person's motives for doing what he did. </li>
      <li> avoid making comparisons with other
        people. </li>
      <li> avoid raising questions about the person's
        loyalty or commitment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ways to deliver constructive criticism - </p>
    <p>Bringing up a problem can be the hardest
      part of communicating effectively. If the
      person has seen you (or others in the family)
      do what you will be discussing, mention
      that you are also working on this problem.
      This makes you partners against the
      problem.
      Grace has done this in the following
      scenario. Compare this with her statements
      earlier about loading the dishwasher. Do
      you feel differently about the way the
      criticism was given?</p>
    <p>I'd like to talk about the way the bathroom
      is left after Grandpa has his shower. I
      know he throws his damp towels on the
      floor; I would like them put in the laundry
      I step in puddles of water when I go in the
      bathroom and I worry about slipping and
      falling. ·You can use the mop in the kitchen
      closet or the damp towels to soak up the
      puddles. I would appreciate it if you would
      make sure the floor is dry Thanks.</p>
    <p>Grace's criticism was constructive because
      she applied the following suggestions. She
      used an "I" statement when she said, "I step
      in puddles." She focused on the problem,
      not the person, by saying, ''I'd like to talk
      about the way the bathroom is left." She was
      specific when she said, "You can use the damp
      towel to soak up the puddles." She focused
      on the issue of concern-the bathroom. She
      didn't mention the dishwasher.
      The following are additional tools for
      giving constructive criticism:</p>
    <p>Phrase questions carefully - Your
      questions and comments can help or hurt.
      Asking why the person did something
      sounds accusatory Frequently people don't
      know why they did something. Questions
      beginning with <em>how</em>, <em>what</em>, and <em>when</em> sound like you are gathering information,
      not blaming. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>How do you usually do this?</em></li>
      <li><em>What do you think went wrong?</em></li>
      <li><em>When does the problem arise?</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Offer face-saving comments - Your intent
      is to protect the person's pride and feelings
      by offering valid, impersonal reasons for
      what has happened. Ask yourself the aikido
      question when a criticism must be given,
      "What does this person need from me to feel better or to save face? Protection from
      embarrassment? A chance to improve without
      having to apologize?" Some examples of
      face-savers are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>I can see how a mistake could be made.
        The directions are confusing.</em></li>
      <li><em>This is easy to forget, especially when it's
        a busy time.</em></li>
      <li><em>I hope we can continue to talk things
        over at a later time.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>End on a positive note - You can end
      on an upbeat note by mentioning positive,
      helpful contributions the person has made
      and expressing your belief that things will
      work out. For example, Gerald said to an
      in-home worker:</p>
    <p>I notice how patient you are when talking
      to Dad, especially when he keeps asking
      who you are. One thing I've become more
      sensitive to when talking to Dad is to
      say 'you' instead of 'we.' It sounds more
      respectful to say 'How are you today?'
      instead of 'How are we today?' With a little
      forethought, this can be an easy change to
      make. And it's a change I will appreciate
      very much.</p>
    <p>Responding to criticism - </p>
    <p>Although you may do your best to offer
      criticism in a constructive manner, you may
      not always be treated in the same way. This
      can be infuriating even when you sense a
      criticism has merit. Being open to criticism
      isn't easy, but it's important. As a caregiver
      you may be offended by criticism you feel
      is neither deserved nor wanted. How does
      one deal with criticism? The Boy Scouts say
      it best: "Be prepared." Here are some other
      tools that will help: </p>
    <p>Think about the merits of the criticism,
      not just how it makes you feel - Does the
      criticism have merit? Did the person truly
      criticize or was he expressing a concern that
      you viewed as a criticism? For example, if
      you were told you needed help to provide
      care, would you see it as a criticism of your
      ability? Are there times when you could be
      wrong? If so, it shows true grit to admit a
      mistake and apologize. just be sure your
      apology doesn't have the word "if' in it.
      Saying ''I'm sorry if I was wrong" suggests
      you don't really believe you were wrong.
      A genuine apology has no "ifs" and says,
      "I was wrong and I'm sorry."</p>
    <p> Use your aikido skills if the criticism
      is valid - Step into the other person's shoes
      and try to see things from his point of
      view. Ask what needs to change for him
      to feel better: "I need to understand what
      you want done differently." Perhaps you
      can't make the changes he wants, but you
      can listen with respect and concern. That
      might be all he wanted. (See Chapter 3 for
      information about aikido.)</p>
    <p>Don't take unjust criticism to heart - Another part of readiness is the ability to
      disregard unfair criticism. You can ignore
      the criticism by simply saying, "I find your
      remarks interesting" and dropping the
      subject. If ignoring the criticism isn't the
      answer, you can calmly assert yourself by
      returning the problem to the critic with a
      statement like, "It would help me if you
      would share how you would have done
      __ ." Or, to deflect criticism, try a remark
      like, "That is another way of looking at
      this ... " If you need time to collect your
      thoughts, tell the person, "I will think
      about what you've said."</p>
    <p>Responding to criticism
      from the care receiver - </p>
    <p>Taking criticism from the person receiving
      your help can be particularly difficult. This
      is especially true if you are the brunt of all
      the criticism and you are doing the most.
      If the criticism is undeserved or invalid,
      try using aikido to respond and try not to
      take the criticism personally. Aikido is a
      very useful tool to use in these situations. It
      tends to disarm the person because he has
      no opponent and is not given "fuel" for an
      argument.
      Some caregivers have also found it helps
      to calmly interrupt when the care receiver
      takes a breath and suggest talking later.
      Other caregivers quietly state that they can't
      listen any longer: "I need to excuse myself
      for a while," and leave the room. Offering
      a snack or something to drink gives you a
      reason to leave the room and may reduce
      the stress of the moment.</p>
    <p>Another option is to suggest the person
      put his criticisms in writing because you
      can't remember everything. (The idea here
      is that people who criticize for the sake of
      criticizing often will not take the time to put
      their criticisms in writing.) This also may
      help to focus you and the care receiver on
      legitimate issues that need to be addressed.
      Remember, you do not have to listen to
      a barrage of unfair and hurtful criticism.
      Regardless of the criticism or its source,
      how you react to it affects how you will feel
      about yourself later. It's gratifying to look
      back on a challenging situation and say to
      yourself, "I handled that very well."</p>
    <p class="subheader">Expressing Anger</p>
    <p>Like most of us, you can probably relate
      to this quote. Being able to express anger in
      ways that are positive
      and not hurtful is
      critical This can be
      especially true when
      you find yourself
      facing emotionally
      charged problems and
      decisions. This happened to Betty when she
      least expected it.</p>
    <p>Betty is 50 years old. She is the youngest
      of three children in the family and the
      only one who lives near their parents,
      who are both in their nineties. Her sister,
      Catherine, lives on the East Coast and
      her brother, Allen, lives in France. Betty thought the family should get together at least once while both the parents were alive. After much planning, a family reunion was held.</p>
    <p>Betty still gets a knot in her stomach when
      she thinks about what happened that
      weekend. Catherine had said she felt the
      folks should move in with Betty because
      they <em>shouldn't live at home alone at their
      age</em>. Allen agreed with Catherine. Betty
      became upset and angry.</p>
    <p>Betty: <em>You're both fine ones to give me
      advice. You do none of the work. You
      never offer to send a dime to help
      me with the folks' expenses. I end
      up doing all the work and paying for
      everything. Now, you have the nerve to
      suggest that they move in with me so I
      can sacrifice what little free time I have
      left to take care of them!</em></p>
    <p>Catherine: <em>I didn't realize you would be
      so touchy about my idea.</em></p>
    <p>Allen: <em>You never asked for any help or
      money How was I to know you
      needed it?'</em></p>
    <p>Betty: <em>Just forget I said anything. You're
      obviously too busy with your own lives
      to care about your own parents and me.</em></p>
    <p>Silence descended on the group. The rest
      of the time was spent avoiding each other
      while trying to be polite in front of their
      parents. The family reunion ended with
      polite good-byes. Nothing had changed,
      except Betty wishes she had handled her
      anger in a better way
      The goal of expressing anger effectively
      is to share your feelings in a positive way so ·
      that people hear what you say versus hearing
      only your anger. Reaching this goal requires
      taking the time to regain perspective and to
      prepare.</p>
    <p>Begin preparing by taking a look at what
      triggers your anger. Is it advice from people
      who don't help? Is it repetitive questions or
      behavior? Is it a request for help just when
      you have a moment to yourself? Once you
      identify the triggers, think of ways to cool
      off before you say anything. Deep-breathing
      and stress reduction activities might help you
      regroup. Counting to ten remains an effective
      way to calm down and think about what
      to say Once you feel composed it helps to
      apply the following communication tools:</p>
    <p>Use <em>I</em> messages in a non-threatening
      manner - Be aware of your body language.
      For example, don't tower over people when
      you talk to them. Place yourself at or below
      eye level when you say, <em>I get upset when
      I get advice instead of help taking care of
      Mother.</em></p>
    <p>Avoid <em>yo</em>u messages - Blaming,
      accusing, and mind-reading are huge
      pitfalls. They usually lead to strong feelings
      of remorse later. </p>
    <p>Speak in a normal tone of voice - Talking fast with a raised voice implies
      anger, regardless of what you actually say.
      Maintaining a moderate tone, volume, and
      rate of speaking suggests you are in control
      of your anger.
      Getting angry is only human and saying
      so is not a bad thing as long as you follow
      the tools for how to best express yourself.</p>
    <p>Responding to anger -</p>
    <p>When we respond to anger,
      our goal is to defuse the
      anger and calm the situation.
      Applying the aikido style of
      communication is an effective
      way to do this. If Catherine
      and Allen would have
      responded this way; the family
      reunion might have turned
      out differently.</p>
    <p> Catherine: <em>If I believed that
      my brother and sister
      didn't care about me
      or the folks, I'd feel the
      same way you do.</em></p>
    <p>Allen: <em>I don't know exactly
      what you need from us.
      Give us an example of what we can do
      from such long distances.</em></p>
    <p>Betty: <em>I figure I spend about $200 a
      month on the folks. I would really
      like some help in covering my out -of pocket
      expenses.</em></p>
    <p>Catherine: <em>I can see we have a problem.
      What would you like me to do to help?
      I don't have much money.</em></p>
    <p>Betty: <em>If you could come out once a year
      and keep an eye on the folks so I could
      take a vacation, it would be a big help.</em></p>
    <p> In this example, Catherine and Allen
      aligned with Betty They empathized with
      her feelings and asked for more information.
      This told Betty they cared. Meanwhile,
      they received information from Betty to
      redirect the conversation and move toward
      resolving the problem.</p>
    <p>Other possible tools for
      responding to anger -</p>
    <p>Be careful with the following tools because
      they can backfire and make people angrier.
      Your knowledge and experience with the
      person will help you decide if these responses
      are appropriate in your situation.</p>
    <p>Excuse yourself and leave the person
      alone - Sometimes anger builds as it is being
      expressed. You may decide to say; "I have to
      excuse myself. Let's talk when we both feel
      less emotional," and calmly leave the room.
      This is an option if your presence is making
      the person angry, if your safety is at risk,
      or anger is building and the person usually
      calms down when alone. Be careful about
      using this response. There are times when
      even politely leaving the room will increase
      someone's anger.</p>
    <p>Use humor to ease tensions - Humor,
      used wisely, can recast unfairness into
      nonsense. It can help people rethink a
      problem. The difficulty is that not taking
      someone seriously is a powerful act of
      defiance. Using humor can come across as
      insulting or arrogant when it isn't meant
      · that way.
      Either way, there is a risk of increasing
      anger if the person feels you are making fun
      of him or light of an issue.
      Refer to yourself, riot the other person, in
      using humor. <em>So, I guess I'm not 'person
      of the week"' or "Here we are, madder than
      hatters at each other, and Dad is the one
      with the driving problem.</em></p>
    <p>Change the subject - This is risky, too,
      because the person may think you don't
      understand or don't care. He needs to feel
      you have heard him before you change the
      subject. A remark like "You have a good
      reason to be upset. I have news I hope will
      help you feel better ... " may work to lighten
      the atmosphere.
      Expressing anger with blaming and
      accusations or responding to anger with
      anger doesn't promote family unity or help
      to solve problems. The assertiveness and
      aikido communication tools will help you
      accomplish more.</p>

  <h1>Expressing Yourself Under Special Circumstances</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="subheader"> Talking On The Telephone</p>
    <p>Bob lived several hundred miles from his
      father. He called his father weekly, but was
      - increasingly concerned about his father's
      well-being after the calls. He said: </p>
    <p>My dad is 85 years old and very frail. He is
      hard of hearing and has poor vision. Lately
      he seems more forgetful I learned from a
      neighbor that my dad had a blood test at
      the hospital the previous day Dad didn't
      remember anything about it. Every time I
      call, he tells me "Everything is just fine."
      But his voice sounds weaker when he says
      it. I have a feeling something just isn't
      right, so I'm going down for a visit.</p>
    <p> Although telephone conversations can
      reveal clues about potential problems, they
      also can lead you astray. Miscommunication
      can occur because you don't have "the
      messages" that body language and facial
      expression provide. If you want to
      understand what the person means or feels,
      you might have to check with the person
      to make certain you both understand each
      other. For instance: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"From the sound of your voice, I have
        the feeling you are worried. Is there
        something that is worrying you?" </li>
      <li> ''I'm having trouble understanding what
        you mean. Can you explain a little more?" </li>
      <li>"It sounds like you mean (want, need,
        feel) __ . Am I right?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people feel safer talking on the telephone than they do face to face. It's p0!5SltJle
      to capture honest thoughts, concerns, and
      feelings that would not be disclosed in person. If you discover this, try to schedule
      your calls when you won't be interrupted
      and you have time to talk You don't want
      to cut off someone who finally trusts you
      and opens up to you. If your time is short
      when the person calls, mention in advance
      how long you can visit.</p>
    <p>Telephone skills -</p>
    <p>A skilled, considerate telephone listener
      will: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> listen for clues in the tone of voice or
        manner of speaking that are different
        from earlier conversations.</li>
      <li> ask open-ended questions to get more
        information about those clues, like "How
        did you feel?", "What do you mean?", or
        "What do you think about. .. ?" </li>
      <li> confirm what was meant: "Are you saying
        Dad won't agree to stop driving?" </li>
      <li> stop other activities such as housework or
        driving while on the phone. </li>
      <li> take notes. Details of telephone
        conversations are easy to forget, perhaps
        because there is no visual information to
        support what has been said. Taking notes
        helps you remember key concerns and to
        refer to them during future calls. </li>
      <li>summarize the conversation at the end to
        clarify what you both said.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Communicate With The Doctor</p>
    <p>As you provide care over the years, you
      wear various hats. You are an expert in the care 
      of your relative, a consumer of health
      care services, and the person who works with  
      the doctors. You may also be a patient occasionally. In any case, you want to build
      p~trtr1ershiip with the physician and other
      health care providers. You, as well as the
      physician and his or her staff, have a role in
      forming and maintaining this relationship. </p>
    <p>What to consider before
      going to the doctor -</p>
    <p>Think about the main reasons for your
      visit and what you expect from the doctor
      as you prepare for your visit. Consider the
      following tools. </p>
    <p>Prepare your questions. - </p>
    <p>Make a list in
      advance of your most important concerns
      and questions. This increases the likelihood
      your office visits will meet your needs. </p>
    <p>Consider other reliable sources of
      information - </p>
    <p>Before you decide what questions
      you want to ask the doctor, consider
      other reliable sources of information. Your pharmacist can answer questions about
      medications and the office nurse may have
      answers to your caregiving questions. Most
      caregiving issues relate more closely to
      nursing than to medicine. Also, the nurse
      usually has extensive knowledge about the .
      doctor's patients, their illnesses, and the ·
      treatments prescribed.
      Don't worry about asking the nurse questions
      the doctor should or prefers to answer.
      The nurse will refer you to the doctor for
      those questions. Depending on her background
      and the doctor's wishes, you can
      usually ask a nurse questions regarding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what you can learn from various tests and
        examinations.</li>
      <li> scheduling tests and what you have to do
        to prepare for tests or surgical procedures.</li>
      <li> providing personal care and measures to
        prevent problems such as pressure sores. </li>
      <li> managing medications at home. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also can obtain information from
      support groups, specialty clinics, your
      local health department, and organizations
      dealing with certain health problems such
      as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,
      and stroke. These organizations offer free
      or inexpensive educational materials or can
      tell you where to get them. Sharing this
      information with non-caregiving relatives
      gives them an objective overview of the
      illness and related caregiving issues.</p>
    <p>Make sure appointments meet your
      needs - </p>
    <p>When you call for an appointment,
      be clear about the reasons for the visit so
      the receptionist schedules enough time
      for you or the care receiver. Experience
      has shown that the first appointment
      in the morning or after lunch, and the
      last appointment of the day, are the best
      scheduling times.</p>
    <p>Call ahead - </p>
    <p>Office staff suggest calling
      before you leave for the appointment to see
      if the doctor is seeing patients on time. If
      the appointment is for a memory-impaired
      relative, mention problems the person
      might have if kept waiting. Remind the
      receptionist of these special needs when
      you check in at the desk. </p>
    <p>Take someone with you - </p>
    <p>Take a friend or
      relative along if you feel uncomfortable asking
      questions. They can ask questions you
      don't want to ask and help you remember
      what the doctor said. </p>
    <p>Build a relationship with the office staff - Introduce yourself to the doctor's office
      staff. After you get acquainted, consider sending a card during the holidays or
      dropping a note to a staff member-who
      provided exceptional service. Getting to
      know the staff often means better service.</p>
    <p>Talking with the doctor -</p>
    <p>The following tools can help you get the
      most out of your time with the doctor. </p>
    <p>Discuss your main concerns first. This is
      important because if you wait until the end
      of your appointment there may not be time
      to properly deal with the main reasons for
      your visit. You can say something like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"I have something important I want to
        talk about." </li>
      <li>"There are three things I need to
        understand better." </li>
      <li>"I have three important questions to ask." </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be concise - </p>
    <p>Clearly, briefly, and frankly
      discuss your concerns. The doctor will
      ask questions to get the necessary details.
      Lengthy, detailed descriptions of past
      experiences and old health problems are
      usually a waste of your time. </p>
    <p>Refer to a second party - </p>
    <p>If you want
      a second opinion but you hesitate to ask
      for it, tell your doctor. "My and I
      have discussed the importance of getting
      a second opinion." (Remember, there is a
      better chance of getting a second opinion if
      you ask for it than if you don't ask.) </p>
    <p>Get your questions answered - </p>
    <p>Ask
      about tests and treatments and the reasons
      for them.</p>
    <p>+'What do you expect to learn from the test?
      When can I expect to hear the results of
      ' the test? </p>
    <p>+How will I (or my relative) feel afterward? </p>
    <p>+ Are there other options to having this test?</p>
    <p>Ask about treatment plans - </p>
    <p>Ask about
      medications and treatments that don't seem
      to work. Ask about alternatives for any
      treatment you find burdensome, such as a
      medication that must be taken in the
      middle of the night. Ask for clarification
      about the. diagnosis and treatment plan· and
      the reasons the doctor recommends it, what
      the treatment will accomplish, and restrictions
      on activities, food, or driving and the
      reasons for the restrictions. Find out about
      recovery and how long it will take to get
      back to normal, not just to feel better.</p>
    <p> Telephone calls to the doctor -</p>
    <p>Most of us have called the doctor and
      waited for a call back. Because a doctor
      may not be able to return a call right
      away, caregivers and health care providers
      recommend that you briefly describe the
      reason for your call and ask when you
      can expect the doctor to return your call.
      Be prepared to answer some questions. If
      you're calling about a new symptom, the
      doctor will probably want to know what the
      symptom is, when it appeared, what you
      think causes it, and if it is getting worse. Be
      prepared to answer such questions.</p>
    <p class="subheader">When Getting Needed Information
      Is a Problem</p>
    <p>Some caregivers find they can't get the
      information they need about their family
      member's condition and functioning because
      their relative won't tell them. It is important
      · to understand the reasons a person may
      not want to disclose health matters. Some
      people fear losing privacy or control.
      This lack of trust on the part of the care
      receiver can hurt and frustrate caregivers.
      If you have this problem, you face some
      difficult choices. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Do you ask the care receiver if you can
        talk to the doctor? </li>
      <li> Do you politely tell him you will be
        talking to his physician? </li>
      <li> Do you contact the doctor even though
        you were told not to? </li>
      <li> Do you just talk to the doctor without
        telling the care receiver at all? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everyone's situation is unique, but it's
      better to ask your relative about talking to
      the doctor. Would you agree or disagree with
      Judy's response in the following conversation? </p>
    <p>Judy: "Dad, I need a better understanding
      of how you are doing. I realize you
      don't want to talk to me about it so I'd
      like to talk to your doctor." </p>
    <p>Dad: "No, I don't want you t9. No." </p>
    <p>Judy: "What is it about my talking to your
      doctor that bothers you?" </p>
    <p>Dad: "Frankly, I don't think my health is
      anybody's business but mine." </p>
    <p>Judy: "I agree that your health is a private
      matter. Privacy is important to me too.
      I will keep what the doctor says in
      strict confidence. But I can't help you
      if I don't know what to do. I have
      questions that need answering." </p>
    <p>Judy called the doctor. She briefly
      explained the caregiving situation and told
      the doctor she did not have her dad's
      permission to call, but 'he knew she was
      calling. She asked for the information she
      needed and the doctor gave it to her. Leona's
      story is a little different. </p>
    <p>Today, Leona's doctor told her she had
      Parkinson's disease. Leona told her doctor
      that under no circumstances did she want
      her daughter Elaine to know her diagnosis.
      Leona fears the diagnosis will be the
      last straw because Elaine already helps
      Leona manage her diabetes, take care of
      the house, and run errands. She strongly
      believes Elaine would pressure her into
      moving to an assisted living facility. </p>
    <p>Leona's demand places the doctor in an
      awkward position. While he respects her
      right to confidentiality, he also needs
      assurances his prescribed treatment can be
      carried out. Leona clearly needs Elaine's
      help to do this. Faced with dilemmas like
      this one, some doctors may decline to provide
      further care. The prospect of losing the
      doctor usually changes the patient's mind.</p>
    <p> If you suspect that, medically, more is
      going on than your relative will tell you,
      talk to the doctor about it. If possible,
      mention specific problems your relative is
      having that worry you: ''I'm helping my
      mother get along at home and manage her
      diabetes. I've noticed she has a tremor and
      seems unsteady when she walks. I need
      to know if she has other health problems
      besides her diabetes because I am responsible
      for her care."</p>
    <p>The following tools may also help to deal
      with this difficult situation.</p>
    <p>Tell your family member you cannot
      help without certain information from his
      doctor - Mention that health care professionals
      require similar information to provide
      the best care possible. If your relative still
      refuses to share information, you could say: </p>
    <p>+ "I'd like your permission to talk to your
      doctor about. .. "</p>
    <p> + "I can't help you without talking to your
      doctor." </p>
    <p>+ "I will have to tell your doctor. I can't help
      carry out his treatment orders without
      knowing what's wrong." </p>
    <p>Get the doctor involved - </p>
    <p>Talk with the
      doctor. Ask for information on a "need to
      know" basis. Tell the doctor about the care
      receiver's objections. Be clear that you are
      requesting only information you need to
      help your relative. If the doctor reassures
      your relative that only information about
      his current illness will be shared, your
      relative may agree. </p>
    <p>Talk to a trusted friend, relative, or
      religious advisor - </p>
    <p>Without betraying confidences,
      explain that you cannot provide the
      best possible care without knowing your
      relative's medical problems. If they agree to
      get involved, it is best to tell the care receiver
      up front that you talked to them because
      you were concerned. </p>
    <p>Respect your relative's need for
      confidentiality - </p>
    <p>Build trust by sharing only
      caregiving problems that do not undermine
      the person's dignity and privacy. Ask, "If I
      had this problem would I want it discussed
      with others?" If you still aren't sure, ask
      permission from your relative before you
      discuss a concern with someone else. </p>
    <p class="subheader">Communicating with Older Adults</p>
    <p> The communication tools discussed so
      far also apply when communicating with
      chronically iii, frail, older people. However,
      it's important to consider how health related
      problems may affect communication.
      Age-related changes in vision and hearing
      affect 50 percent of people over age 75.
      Approximately 10 percent of people over
      age 65 experience memory loss as a result
      of Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder.
      You will be able to communicate more effectively
      if you try some of the following tools. </p>
    <p>The hearing-impaired -</p>
    <p>To communicate more effectively with
      the person who is hearing-impaired, try
      these tools: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Approach the person so he can see you to
        avoid startling him. </li>
      <li> Stand or sit between three and six feet
        away from him. </li>
      <li> Get the person's attention before speaking. </li>
      <li> Place yourself so the light is on your face
        for better visibility of lip movements,
        facial expressions, and gestures. </li>
      <li> Speak at a normal rate using normal lip
        movements. </li>
      <li> Do not shout. Yelling distorts sound,
        making it even more difficult for the
        person to hear. </li>
      <li> Use one-sentence explanations. </li>
      <li>Use gestures (nod, point, beckon) and
        demonstrate what you mean.</li>
      <li>Avoid eating, chewing. gum, smoking, and
        turning away from the person while you
        are speaking.</li>
      <li> Do not speak directly into his ear. He
        will hear you more loudly but not more
        clearly. </li>
      <li> Reduce background noise and activity. </li>
      <li> Remember that hearing aids make all
        sounds louder, not just your voice. </li>
      <li> Be aware of false impressions. Head
        nodding doesn't necessarily mean
        "I understand." </li>
      <li> Give time for the person to respond. </li>
      <li> Explore adaptive and assistive  listening
        devices. These include pocket size
        amplifiers and speakers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The visually-impaired -</p>
    <p> Use these tools with the person who has
      limited vision. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Announce your presence. Speak as you
        enter the room to avoid startling. </li>
      <li> Ask if the lighting in the room is adequate. </li>
      <li> Speak normally and directly. Remember,
        just because a person is sight -impaired
        doesn't mean he can't hear or talk. </li>
      <li>Use a gentle touch, if appropriate. It may
        help him focus on you. </li>
      <li> Tell him when you are leaving the room. </li>
      <li> Obtain low-vision aids. These devices
        help a person make the best possible use
        of remaining vision. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The memory-impaired -<br>
    </p>
    <p> Figuring out how much a person with
      memory problems understands takes some
      detective work. It can get confusing because
      some people can read aloud without understanding
      a word they read. Others may
      respond with smiles and nods to your words
      without understanding a word you said.
      Still others understand what they see and
      hear but cannot find the words to respond. </p>
    <p>Once you realize what aids the person in
      understanding, you can take measures to
      communicate in those ways. For example,
      if your relative cannot understand writing,
      pictures may be helpful. If he can't find the
      bathroom, a picture of a toilet on the bathroom
      door may solve the problem. If your
      spoken word is not understood, try using
      gestures and demonstrate what you mean.
      For example, pat the seat of the chair while
      saying, "Please sit down," or demonstrate
      a task one step at a time, allowing time for
      the person to imitate what you do. These
      tasks may range from getting dressed to
      making a sandwich or setting the table. </p>
    <p>There are many special tools for communicating
      with people who have memory loss.
      Organizations dealing with such problems as
      stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's
      disease, have materials written specifically
      for families. Look in the telephone directory
      under the name of the disease or call the
      social services department of your local
      hospital. Chapter 17, "Caring for Memory Impaired
      Elders," addresses this topic in
      greater detail. </p>
    <p>Additional information about hearing
      and visual impairment is available through
      local hearing and speech specialists or
      specialty clinics.</p>
    <p>Setting the stage
      for effective communication -</p>
    <p>Choose a time to talk that is best for
      the person - Select a day when little else is
      going on. Select a time when the person
      feels rested and medication levels are at
      their most effective levels. Try to fit your
      visit in his routine so he doesn't have to
      delay or skip a daily activity or miss a
      favorite television or radio program. Make
      sure he has eaten and doesn't need to use
      the toilet. Adjust the room temperature and
      lighting to his liking. </p>
    <p>Remove as many distractions as possible - As we grow older, we are more easily
      distracted by noise and activity in the
      surroundings. Search the Web for possible distractions.</p>
    <p>Speak directly and clearly - Older people
      respond better to clear messages. "I noticed
      some meat has spoiled in the refrigerator.
      May I throw it away?" or "Your doctor
      wants to see you this month. I'll be glad to
      take you." They may not take a subtle hint
      like "Hasn't it been a long time since you
      saw your doctor?"</p>
    <p class="subheader"> If the Care Receiver Mistreats You </p>
    <p>Bill, a 48-year-old son, said: </p>
    <p>When my mother died, my wife and I
      decided to turn the daylight basement into
      an apartment for my dad, Joe. At 78, he
      was lonely and becoming more forgetful.
      He moved in six months ago. My wife,
      Marie, provides most of his care. It is just
      not working. Our teenage sons avoid him
      because he constantly criticizes them.
      Lately they've been spending a lot of time
      at their friends' homes. When he wants
      something, he yells at us. The stress of
      putting up with this is too great. Last night
      we decided Dad will have to move into an
      assisted living facility.</p>
    <p> Charlotte, a retired nurse, said: </p>
    <p>Robert's cold, angry look stopped me in
      my tracks and he wasn't even looking at me. He was looking at his wife. Even
      though it was years ago, I still remember
      how he silenced his wife without saying
      a word. I was attending a stroke support
      group meeting. The man I'm talking
      about actively participated in the group
      discussion while his wife sat quietly
      behind his wheelchair. I wondered how
      long the woman could continue caring for
      someone who treated her so unkindly</p>
    <p>What do you do if the care receiver
      trespasses on your rights or hurts your
      feelings? Do you feel you must suspend
      your rights because of the person's age or
      health problems? If the person speaks or,
      like the men in the stories, communicates
      in such a way that you feel hurt or "put
      down," do you just "grin and bear it"?
      If a care receiver mistreats
      you or uses helplessness to control
      you, you will likely become
      resentful. Your feelings of resentment
      will eventually affect your
      ability to provide care. Letting
      resentment build and saying
      nothing is a disservice both to
      you and to the care receiver.
      If he sees no consequences to
      mistreating you, the behavior
      will continue.</p>
    <p>The reality is that a price is
      paid for mistreating the caregiver.
      The cost comes as the
      caregiver's physical and mental
      health suffers and talk of
      placement surfaces. Another
      consequence of mistreatment may come in
      the use of medications to control aggressive
      behavior. Often these medications are powerful
      and may have unwanted side effects.
      Caregiver burnout, placement, and the
      use of potent medications are high prices
      to pay for not dealing with mistreatment.
      If you need a refresher, refer to assertiveness
      (in Chapter 3) and dealing with anger
      and criticism sections of this chapter. You
      may also find support groups and professional
      counseling helpful. Your effectiveness
      as a caregiver and your relative's ability to
      remain at home may lie in your ability to
      communicate limits and consequences in a
      clear, kind, but firm manner.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Challenging Communication Styles</h1>
  <div class="content" >
    <p>The challenges of providing care increase
      when communication breaks down. This
      can happen with certain communication
      styles. These styles frequently emerge when
      stress is at peak levels or when people must
      make difficult decisions. Also, sometimes
      people use these styles because they have
      always worked. This section will briefly
      discuss tools for communicating more
      effectively; with three such styles: passive/
      peacekeeping, aggressive/pitbull, and
      factual/computer.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Passive/Peacekeeping Style</p>
    <p>"Peace at any price" is a motto for people
      who use the passive/peacekeeping style
      to communicate. However, when honest
      concerns and feelings are not raised, it can
      potentially undermine important relationships
      and decision making. Making sound
      decisions becomes difficult because the true
      nature of problems remains hidden and
      cannot be clearly identified and resolved. </p>
    <p>Sharon: "Usually I say nothing when my
      father-in-law ridicules my family and
      me because I'm afraid of making him
      mad. Or I end up saying 'I don't mean
      to sound disrespectful' and apologizing
      to him, even though I've done nothing
      wrong." </p>
    <p>Judy: "When our family gets together to
      decide how to help Grandma, my sister
      Christy won't tell us what she wants to
      do. She always wants the rest of us to
      choose what we want to do first. When
      we ask her to tell u;; what she wants,
      she says, 'Anything is fine with me.'
      Yesterday, Ken told me Christy gets
      tired of doing what nobody else wants
      to do." </p>
    <p>We have called the passive style Sharon
      and Christy used a peacekeeping style.
      This is the style where people hope and
      hint rather than speak directly They use
      apologetic, self-defeating language such as
      "I don't mean to sound ... " Their personal
      needs nearly always take second place to
      the needs of others. Christy did this when
      she said, "Anything is fine with me."</p>
    <p> It's also easy to fall into this peacekeeping
      style when providing care because often
      caregivers don't feel they can speak openly
      to someone who is elderly or sick. Some
      people who receive care may feel the same
      way for a different reason. They might feel
      uncomfortable speaking up because they
      are dependent on the goodwill of the
      caregiver to meet their needs.
      Sometimes people use a passive style
      because they fear speaking honestly to a
      person who comes across as judgmental or
      controlling. Perhaps Sharon felt that way
      when she said "I don't mean to sound ..." </p>
    <p>Sometimes people are passive because they
      are afraid of rejection or they don't want
      to jeopardize an important relationship by
      being open. The peacekeeper's intent is to
      please, not to deceive. People seeking to
      please may also: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> seek approval and want to stay in another's
        good graces. </li>
      <li> avoid confrontation; they might even go
        so far as to agree with their own critics. </li>
      <li> feel they are accountable for everything
        that goes wrong.</li>
      <li>feel they are responsible for other peoples
        happiness.</li>
      <li> be unable to ask for things and therefore
        use compliments or guilt to manipulate
        others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tools for -communicating
      with peacekeepers -</p>
    <p>You want to be clear that it is safe to
      speak openly to you. You may have to say
      directly that you won't get upset or think
      less of the person. A gentle, assertive style
      may be effective. The aikido style may
      not be direct enough to ferret out hidden
      information. However, the aikido style
      may work to encourage the person to
      share his feelings with you. In either case, you
      encourage peacekeepers to speak openly if
      you apply the following tools: </p>
    <p>Recognizing how you come across - </p>
    <p>If a
      person uses the peacekeeping style to relate
      to you, ask yourself if you may be the
      reason. For example, are you coming across
      as judgmental or controlling? Being aware
      of your role allows you to act on it by
      reassuring the person he can say "No" or
      express his feelings without fear of criticism,
      retaliation, or judgment. For instance, you
      might say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Please tell me more. I didn't realize .. '." </li>
      <li>"I won't get upset if you tell me how you
        feel about what happened." </li>
      <li>"I want to understand. I'm not here to
        criticize."</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Use a direct, calm, unhurried speaking
      style - </p>
    <p>This relaxing manner encourages
      openness. You can see the aikido style in
      the following openers: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"I can only imagine how hard this is
        for you." </li>
      <li>"I understand how (sad, annoying,
        worrisome) that would be." </li>
      <li>"I'm interested in what's important to you." </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Give the person your undivided
      attention - </p>
    <p>This shows you respect him and
      what he has to say.</p>
    <p> What happens if you use this style?
      If you communicate in a passive manner
      you voluntarily give up your right to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> have a role in making decisions. </li>
      <li> advise others of your limits and needs. </li>
      <li> get the information and help you want
        and need from professionals and family
        members.</li>

    <p class="subheader">Aggressive/Pitbull Style</p>
    <p>Joe is a 78-year-old widower. Alone and
      becoming forgetful, he agreed to move into
      the basement apartment his son constructed
      for him. Joe's wife was the quiet type; so Joe
      is used to "wearing the pants in the family."
      Living with his son and two teenagers isn't
      easy. Marie, his daughter-in-law; is easygoing,
      but must cope with Joe's speaking style. </p>
    <p>Joe shouted to his grandsons: 'Turn down
      that terrible music! You never stop to
      think someone else might not want to
      hear that junk. And, look at you! You
      are wearing jeans with holes in them.
      Why don't you ever wear clothes that
      look decent? (Turning to Marie) Why
      don't you put your foot down, Marie?"</p>
    <p>Marie: "Boys, turn down the music, it's
      upsetting your grandfather. I wish you
      three could get along."</p>
    <p>The person who uses the aggressive/
      pitbull style of communicating is focused
      on getting his way and ignores the feelings
      and the rights of others. Joe's "you" statements
      accuse his grandsons of being thoughtless
      and slovenly. Joe, and others like him,
      use this style to maintain power and to
      control other people. At times, people who
      need assistance use this style to regain some
      control over their lives. People using an
      aggressive style may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> use anger and temper tantrums to
        intimidate. </li>
      <li> use criticism and ridicule to discourage
        the efforts of others.</li>
      <li> make jokes at other people's expense to
        undermine their self-esteem. </li>
      <li> list failings for the other person's "own
        good," injuring their self-confidence. </li>
      <li>blame others by using red flag phrases
        such as "even you," "don't you even
        (care)," "you should," "you always,"
        "you never," and "why don't you ever?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tools for dealing with aggressiveness -</p>
    <p>The intent is to stop the aggression. If
      you reply in a pitbull mode, a shouting
      match develops. But if you wait without
      interrupting, the aggressor eventually runs
      out of things to say.
      You can also reduce the need to be aggressive.
      If the person is angry, deal with his
      anger If the person wants complete  control over his or her life, find ways they 
      can regain it by offering choices whenever possible and encouraging independence.
      Some tools for dealing with aggressiveness
      include: </p>
    <p>Try the aikido-aligning style - </p>
    <p>Agreeing
      can have a disarming effect on people who
      are communicating in an aggressive manner.
      It is the last thing they expect and it surprises
      them. When a person's emotions get out of
      control, agreeing seems to initiate some calmness.
      Marie might have said, "Yes, the boys
      do wear jeans with holes in them. I know it's
      hard to believe, but it's the style these days."</p>
    <p> Concentrate on areas of common concern
      or agreement - </p>
    <p>Asking the individual to elaborate
      on areas of common concern is pure
      diplomacy. For example, Marie could have
      said, "Sometimes I have trouble accepting
      how the boys dress, too. When I went to
      school, wearing clothes with holes in them
      was embarrassing. Was it that way for you?" </p>
    <p>Ask about feelings - </p>
    <p>Sometimes agreement
      doesn't work. Asking about feelings is
      usually the next best step. Marie might say,
      "I need to know what has upset you." </p>
    <p>Express appreciation - </p>
    <p>Sometimes people
      attack indirectly. They may offer criticism
      about the way you provide care "for your
      own good" or for the good of the ill person.
      It is difficult, but often effective, to respond
      to this type of aggression with, "Thank you
      for sharing that. I'm always open to new ideas." </p>
    <p>Deal with indirect put-downs directly - </p>
    <p>Jokes made at another person's expense
      in the name of "good fun" are a form of
      aggression. The aggressor acts surprised
      when the person expresses indignation
      and may say, "Just kidding." Consider the
      following situation in which Bert put a stop
      to Betty's little jokes and he did it with class.</p>
    <p>Bert: "Betty, I felt insulted at your remark that I couldn't balance a checkbook if my life depended on it."</p>
    <p>Betty: "Can't you take a joke?"</p>
    <p>Bert: "I know the joke wasn't meant to insult me but I don't think jokes made
      at my expense are funny."</p>
    <p>Betty: "You are really getting thin-skinned."</p>
    <p>Bert: <em>I don't want it to happen again. If it does, I will call you on it. It won't be
      funny when I say, 'I don't think jokes made at my expense are funny, Betty.</em></p>
    <p>Bert did a lot of things right. He prepared
      himself ahead of time. He privately practiced
      what he would say and how he would say
      it. He gave Betty a face-saving excuse for
      her remarks: "I know the joke wasn't meant
      to insult me." He used "I" statements and
      he used the DESC method. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe: He described what Betty said by
        using quotes. </li>
      <li>Express: He expressed his feelings: "I don't
        think jokes made at my expense are
        funny."</li>
      <li> Specify: He told her he didn't want it to
        happen again. (He also ignored Betty's
        "thin-skinned" remark and kept his
        focus on the 'joke.")</li>
      <li> Consequence: He told her what would
        happen if she did it again: "I will call
        you on it."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What happens if you use this style? -</p>
    <p>Aggressive behavior creates a vicious
      cycle for those dealing with chronic
      conditions because the mere threat of an
      angry outburst can keep friends and family
      away. It distances people. This distancing
      reinforces the aggressor's belief that no
      one really cares. If the aggressor is the care
      receiver, the stress caused by aggressive
      behavior may hasten moving the person
      into a professional care setting. </p>
    <p>There are times when all of us use the pitbull
      style to get what we want or to express
      our frustration or anger. The hardest, shortest,
      and best way to get back on track is to
      acknowledge our misstep and, using an "I"
      statement, apologize for it.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Factual/Computer Style</p>
    <p>Some people seek to prevent closeness by
      using a factual manner to relate to others.
      The belief is that people use this style of
      communication to avoid showing their true
      feelings. Not only do they wish to remain
      emotionally anonymous, they usually show
      little or no interest in how other people feel.
      Ed is an example of the factual style. Ed
      and his sister, Nan, were meeting at a local
      cafe to discuss their mothers driving. Nan
      saw it as a problem and Ed didn't. </p>
    <p>Ed: "Some older people drive until they are
      well into their 90s. One wouldn't think
      driving to the grocery store would be
      such a problem. Most elderly need the
      independence driving gives them." </p>
    <p>Nan: ''You're right, many older people do
      continue to drive. Many older people
      also voluntarily quit driving and remain
      ' independent by using local transportation
      services. Moms driving worries
      me. Did she tell you about the parking
      meter she totaled last week? Did you
      know that she got a ticket for passing
      a school bus unloading children, and
      that Tuesday she got lost on her way to my house?"</p>
    <p>Ed: "Actually, not driving would save on
      insurance and car maintenance. The
      money saved could go for cab fare.
      There are definitely advantages to
      consider."</p>
    <p>Nan gave Ed the telephone numbers of
      the city bus service and the closest senior
      center to contact. They discussed contacting
      businesses that offer delivery services.
      She knew Ed would be comfortable doing
      the research and she would help her mother
      deal with her feelings and concerns.</p>
    <p>"Calm, cool, and collected" describes the
      factual style of communicating. Unwilling
      or unable to share feelings, the person
      speaks in impersonal terms, such as "some,"
      "most/' "one," and "everyone" instead of
      "r' and "we." ''Some" and "most" are also
      commonly used words. A factual-style sentence
      sounds like "Some older people drive
      well into their 90s," or "Most older people
      need the independence driving gives them."</p>
    <p>Tools for relating to the factual style -</p>
    <p> The goal in responding to people who
      use the factual style to communicate is to
      adapt to it. The goal is not to make these
      people express their feelings. Using assertiveness
      or mirroring the factual style works
      well. The following suggestions may help
      you communicate more effectively.</p>
    <p>Imitate the person's style - </p>
    <p>If you try to solicit the person's feelings with a question like <em>How do you feel about that?</em> person may retreat further. Use the same impersonal language he uses. For example, change your question to <em>What do you think about that?</em> When responding, <em>feeling</em> words such as <em>concerned</em> <em> happy</em> with the word <em>interesting</em> to describe what was said. Nan might have said <em>It's interesting that some older people drive until they are well into their ninetieth year.</em></p>
    <p>Give the person credit for being right - </p>
    <p>We all like to be told we are right. Once you have agreed on the person's "rightness," he will generally become more receptive to · different options and your ideas. Nan did this when she agreed that "many older people do continue to drive."</p>
    <p>Give the person intellectual tasks - </p>
    <p>People who relate to others in this way often
      prefer dealing with caregiving problems
      that involve facts or research, rather than
      emotions. They might do well and enjoy
      helping in areas of researching resources
      and dealing with finances and taxes. </p>
    <p>What happens if you use this style? -</p>
    <p>There is good news and bad news. The
      good news is, you can use this style. Because
      it is a neutral response, it is effective in
      emotional, guilt-laden, no-win situations.
      For instance: </p>
    <p>Non-caregiving expert: "Your mother seems
      lonely. I'm sure she would love to live
      with you." </p>
    <p>You (in factual style): "Many people think
      older people want to live with their
      children. Research shows they actually
      prefer living in their own homes even
      when they live alone." </p>
    <p>The bad news is, if you are like most
      caregivers, you occasionally want praise or
      approval. If you want praise or approval
      from a factual/computer-style communicator,
      you have to ask for it.</p>

  <h1>Setting your Goals and Making Action Plans</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Perhaps as you read the Lesson on Communication you found some areas to work on. Improving your effectiveness as a listener or speaker is easier if you decide on specific goals. Setting goals provides focus and direction.</p>
    <p>The next step is making an action plan. An action plan is like a short-term contract to meet a goal. An action plan should include with whom, what, and when you
      will apply a communication tool. The activity
      in the box on the next page can help you
      with your action plan.</p>
    <p class="blog">Finally, post on the Forum how confident you are that you will do it (1 = not confident; O = fully confident). Write one goal for listening. Write one goal for expressing yourself. Check the goal you want to work on first.</p>
    <p>Caregiving is not easy, and enhancing your "box of communication tools" is extra work and does take practice. However, improved communication skills results in better relationships. And being able to communicate your limits and ask for help in positive ways will decrease feelings of frustration and resentment. You deserve rewards for your efforts. Think of some way to congratulate yourself for applying the communication tools discussed in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="subheader">SUMMARY</p>
    <p>Common themes reappear throughout the communication lesson. Here are some qualities and principles to strive for as caregivers: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Listen carefully in an accepting and non judgmental way to show you care.</li>
      <li>Stand up for yourself without stepping on the rights and feelings of others.</li>
      <li> Create an environment in which people feel safe sharing with you. </li>
      <li> Respect your needs by setting limits and asking for help in a clear, direct, positive way</li>
      <li>Find a mutual benefit in redefining common goals. </li>
      <li> Focus on issues as problems and not on people as problems.</li>
      <li>Avoid blaming others.</li>
      <li> Prepare ahead of time for contacts with health care professionals so you and the care receiver obtain the best care and advice possible. </li>
      <li> Continue to refine your communication tools to enhance your effectiveness in dealing with daily concerns.</li>
