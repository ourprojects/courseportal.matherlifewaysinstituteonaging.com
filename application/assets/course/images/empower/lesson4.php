  <h1>Myths and Realities of Aging</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Images of aging in our society are not very positive. For example, let’s look at some of our stereotypes about older adults: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Old people can’t learn new things. </li>
      <li>Old people are close-minded, set in their ways. </li>
      <li>Old people are cantankerous, crabby. </li>
      <li>Old people are slow. </li>
      <li>The elderly don’t pull their own weight. </li>
      <li>Old people are always sick.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dr. Erdman Palmore developed a “Facts on Aging” quiz to measure perceptions (and misperceptions) about aging. Dr. Palmore’s quiz is a good way to look at our concepts of aging. Let’s look at some of these items and see how you score them:</p>
    <p>The majority of older people are senile, have a defective memory, or are disoriented.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="subheader">Realities of Aging</p>
    <p>So, if the stereotype of older adults as slow, sick, and/or senile is false, what is the reality of aging in America? The National Council on the Aging and AARP published the resource, American Perceptions of Aging in the 21st Century, a longitudinal study that began in 1974. In 2002 a follow-up study compared results from the original 1974 study with contemporary findings. Here are some highlights about the realities of aging:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>58% of older adults were very happy with growing older </li>
      <li>88% felt that social relationships were very important to a meaningful, vital life </li>
      <li>32% felt that new learning was very important to a meaningful, vital life </li>
      <li>47% felt their overall health was excellent to very good </li>
      <li>60% were very or somewhat worried about memory loss as they aged</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How about a few more realities of aging. A survey of key trends in aging conducted by <a href="http://www.matherlifeways.com/re_researchandeducation.asp" target="_blank">Mather  LifeWays Institute on Aging</a> documented the following facts about older adults:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The educational level of the older adult population is increasing. </li>
      <li>Almost half of older adults currently do volunteer work. </li>
      <li>More than 75% of older adults say old age should be defined by a decline in physical or mental functioning rather than a specific age. </li>
      <li>Only 8% of older adults say they are very old. </li>
      <li>Almost 40% of older adults work part-time. </li>
      <li>Older Americans age 65+ comprise 16.3% of the US labor force. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h1>Focusing on Healthy Aging</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>First of all, how do we define healthy aging? <a href="http://www.ncoa.org/" target="_blank">The National Council on the Aging</a> gives this definition:</p>
    <p>“Healthy aging is a broad concept that is more than just physical health status or absence of disease. It encompasses all of the intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual facts of our being. While healthy aging is driven by internal dimensions such as our beliefs, attitudes, and intentions about our health, it also depends on external supports including our social networks, community services, public policies, and the built and natural environment. These dimensions are interrelated, affecting behavior and lifestyle choices.”</p>
    <p class="subheader">Maintaining Physical Health</p>
    <p>Research shows that older adults can attain healthy vital old age through simple health promotion and disease prevention initiatives. The MacArthur Foundation study identified several lifestyle changes that clearly proved to benefit older adults:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exercise and physical activity </li>
      <li>Early detection of cancer </li>
      <li>Reducing risk of heart disease </li>
      <li>Vaccinations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exercise and physical activity<br>
      Exercise can help prevent heart disease, high blood pressure, and tendency toward diabetes, osteoporosis, and risk for falls. A regular, moderate program of aerobic and strength training for older adults is both safe and effective in improving physical function.</p>
    <p>Early detection of cancer<br>
      With early detection, many forms of cancer are treatable and have a high survival rate. Fortunately, screening tests for early detection of cancer have become very effective and commonly available. In addition, research suggests that promoting a healthy diet may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer.</p>
    <p>Heart disease<br>
      Heart disease is a major killer of men at all ages and of older women. Education about reducing risk factors (high cholesterol, smoking, hypertension) is vitally important for older adults.</p>
    <p>Vaccinations<br>
      Among the greatest advances in health promotion and disease prevention in older adults had been the development of safe and effective vaccines. Among non-vaccinated older adults, disease can sweep through the population rapidly and can be very dangerous.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Maintaining High Cognitive and Physical Function</p>
    <p>Fear of cognitive loss, and especially of Alzheimer’s disease are widespread among older adults, and with good reason. Such losses place great burden on both the older adult and his/ her caregivers. Fortunately, research shows that even though the proportion of older adults in the population is increasing, the usual pattern is that most older adults retain a good portion of their independence and mental sharpness.</p>
    <p><a href="../empower/www.macfound.org" target="_blank">The MacArthur Foundation</a> study documented a number of ways that older adults sustain mental ability as they age. Many of the study’s “successful agers” reported that such activities as reading, conversation, crosswords and other word puzzles, card games, and other similar activities kept their minds alert and active. The study also shows that the strongest predictors of sustained cognitive function include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Education </li>
      <li>Physical activity </li>
      <li>High “self-efficacy”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Education<br>
      People with more years of education were more likely to maintain high cognitive function. The study that education early in life may have a direct beneficial effect of brain circuitry, and education may set a pattern of intellectual pursuits, including reading and puzzle solving, which maintains lifelong exercise of cognitive function.</p>
    <p>Physical Activity<br>
    The study found that older adults who engaged in strenuous physical activity were much more likely to maintain high cognitive function. One possible answer for this is that exercise releases chemicals in the brain which promote the growth of new brain cells.</p>
    <p>Self-efficacy<br>
      Self-efficacy, or self-esteem, is a person’s belief in his or her ability to handle various situations. Many studies show that a strong sense of self-efficacy leads to improved performance in solving cognitive problems. Older adults with strong self-efficacy are more likely to view memory as a set of skills that can be learned and improved.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Engagement in Productive Relationships and Behaviors</p>
    <p>The MacArthur research showed that “happy activities” are essential to successful aging. The two most important areas they identified that contribute to successful aging are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relating to others </li>
      <li>Continuing productive activity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Relating to Others
      Being part of a social network of family and friends contributes significantly to successful aging.</p>
    <p>Continuing Productive Activity
      Most people equate being productive with earning money. However, there are many activities, both paid and unpaid, which can be considered productive.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>Normal Aging Changes </h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="subheader">Hearing Changes</p>
    <p>More than half of people aged 60 or over are hard of hearing or deaf. Presbycusis is the most common form of hearing loss and is thought to be due to the combined effects of aging of the peripheral or central auditory systems, and the accumulated effects of wear-and-tear. </p>
    <p>Older adults may compensate for hearing loss by using hearing aids. However, some older adults don’t recognize their problem and some deny they have problems and thus don’t take actions to correct hearing impairments resulting in potential communication problems. These communication problems can lead to social isolation.</p>
    <p>Strategies for Compensating for Hearing Changes </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand or sit in front of the older adult; get the older adult’s attention. </li>
      <li>Speak up but do not shout. </li>
      <li>Use lower-pitched tones. They are heard more easily than higher ones. </li>
      <li>Speak slowly and clearly, and emphasize only key words. </li>
      <li>Cut out as much background noise as possible. </li>
      <li>Keep your mouth in clear view, and maintain eye contact if possible. </li>
      <li>Rephrase rather than repeat a misunderstood sentence. Allow a few seconds pause after every few sentences to allow for processing and to allow the listener to formulate questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Vision Changes</p>
    <p>About 7.3 million or 21% of persons age 65 and over report some form of vision impairment. As baby boomers age, this number will reach 8.3 million in the year 2010, 11.3 million in 2020, and 14.8 million in 2030.</p>
    <p>Vision loss may be due to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decreased pupil size and accommodation which alter visual accuracy </li>
      <li>Macular degeneration which impedes central vision </li>
      <li>Glaucoma which impeded peripheral vision </li>
      <li>Cataracts which cloud vision.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Strategies for Compensating for Vision Changes</p>
    <p>To accommodate older adults with visual impairments, it is important to make give clear verbal cues to assist the older adult.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are entering a room with someone who is visually impaired, describe the room layout, other people who are in the room, and what is happening. </li>
      <li>Tell the person if you are leaving. Let him/her know if others will remain in the room or if he/she will be alone. </li>
      <li>Allow the person to take your arm for guidance. </li>
      <li>When you speak, let the person know whom you are addressing; </li>
      <li>Ask how you may help: increasing the light, reading the menu, describing where things are, or in some other way. </li>
      <li>Call out the person’s name before touching; touching lets a person know that you are listening. </li>
      <li>Treat him/her like a sighted person as much as possible. </li>
      <li>Explain what you are doing as you are doing it. </li>
      <li>Leave things where they are unless the person asks you to move something.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Changes in Smell and Taste</p>
    <p>Decline in smell and taste are also normal aging sensory changes. Older adults recognize and identify common odors less well. Loss of taste and smell are common and result from: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal aging from the degeneration of the taste buds, and decreased saliva production </li>
      <li>Certain disease states, such as Alzheimer’s disease </li>
      <li>Medications </li>
      <li>Surgical interventions </li>
      <li>Environmental exposure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sensory losses of taste and smell can cause: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reluctance to talk about food </li>
      <li>Reduced pleasure and comfort from food affecting the socialization that accompanies eating </li>
      <li>Increased nutritional and immune deficiencies </li>
      <li>Reduced adherence to dietary regimen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Older adults should be encouraged to have routine oral care and dental visits and to use dentures regularly. To accommodate declines in smell and taste, meals should have pleasing colors, textures, and flavorings to make them look and taste more appealing.</p>
    <p>Common Health Issues of Older Adults</p>
    <p>According to Older Americans 2008: Key Indicators of Well-Being, published by the <a href="../empower/www.agingstats.gov">Federal    Interagency Forum on Age Related Statistics</a>, about 80% of older adults have at least one age- related chronic health condition and 50% have at least two. The most prevalent include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arthritis </li>
      <li>Hypertension </li>
      <li>Heart Disease </li>
      <li>Stroke </li>
      <li>Diabetes </li>
      <li>Cancer </li>
      <li>Osteoporosis </li>
      <li>Alzheimer’s Disease</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Arthritis encompasses more than 100 diseases and conditions that affect joints, surrounding tissues, and other connective tissues. It is the leading cause of disability among older adults. Approximately 43% of all men and 54% of all women over the age of 65 have some level of arthritis.</p>
    <p>Hypertension is also prevalent among older adults and can lead to activity limitations. 52% of all men and 54% of all women over the age of 65 suffer from hypertension.</p>
    <p>Heart Disease and Stroke. Although older women are more likely to have hypertension than older men, the prevalence of heart disease and stroke is higher among older men. 37% of men and 26% of older women have heart disease, while 10% of older men and 8% of older women have suffered a stroke.</p>
    <p>Diabetes also affects the health of older adults and limits their ability to perform normal activities. 19% of men and 17% of women over the age of 65 suffer from diabetes.</p>
    <p>Cancer. Older men are at a greater risk of cancer than older women, 24% of older men and 19% of older women having some form of cancer. For men, the most commonly diagnosed cancers included prostate, lung, colon, and rectum. Among women, cancers of the breast, colon, and rectum were the most common.</p>
    <p>Osteoporosis, another common chronic ailment among older adults, reduces bone density and raises the risk for potential disabling fractures. Although women are four times more likely than men to experience bone loss, recent research suggests that the prevalence of osteoporosis among men has been significantly under-diagnosed and under-reported.</p>
    <p>Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive, degenerative disease that causes gradual but irreversible loss of brain cells. It currently affects an estimated 4.5 million Americans, with the vast majority of sufferers being 65 and older. The group of people who are at the highest risk for Alzheimer’s Disease are those age 85 and older, also the fastest growing segment of the population.</p>
    <p>All statistics are taken from Older Americans 2008: Key Indicators of Well-Being, published by the Federal Interagency Forum on Age Related Statistics. Search the Web for this specific report.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Emotional and Personality Changes</p>
    <p>As we get older, our more dominant personality traits become more pronounced. You may notice that some older people whom you know become “more difficult” to get along with while others become “more mellow” as they age. Some older people may become more concerned about death. Others may feel that they have reached a certain age that their “wisdom” should be respected by everyone and they take offense if someone disagrees or challenges them on an issue.</p>
    <p>As a caregiver, being aware and understanding of some of these changes is important. Showing empathy and compassion to older adults when they may be coping with multiple  changes or losses will benefit both the older person and you as caregiver.</p>
    <p>Emotional, behavioral, and mental change may include depression, memory lapses, inability ot concentrate, or disorientation. It is important to remember that memory lapses are not automatically a sign of dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease! These changes may be caused by a number of factors including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thickening of artery walls </li>
      <li>Poor nutrition </li>
      <li>Action of medications </li>
      <li>Loss of a spouse or death among friends/relatives </li>
      <li>Reduced physical strength and endurance </li>
      <li>Fears of illness </li>
      <li>Major life changes such as moving from one’s home to another setting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the change is sudden and impacts the ability of the older adult to function on a daily basis, it is important to consult with the physician as there may be an underlying cause that could be addressed by medical care.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Memory Changes</p>
    <p>A major concern of people as they or their loved ones age is “What is normal memory loss and what is abnormal?”</p>
    <p>By the time a person reaches 70 to 80 years of age, the brain loses 10% of its original size. Some people’s memory remains sharp throughout old age while others are mildly affected by memory loss.</p>
    <p>As many as 50% of older adults have trouble remembering things, a situation called benign forgetfulness. Some loss of short-term memory is common with older adults, yet they often can easily remember life events and experiences from the past. It is also common that older adults tell and retell information. This is not so much a situation that the older adult does not remember telling the story, but it is a way to “lock in” the story into their short-term memory “bank.”</p>
    <p>As the caregiver, rather than responding in an aggravated tone, “Mom, don’t you remember you just told me that story!”, it is better to just listen and then engage mom in more discussion about that story – maybe ask some questions about the situation or relate it back to a past similar experience. It will help mom “bank” that information, as well as you may learn something you did not know about your mom’s life experiences from the past!</p>
    <p class="subheader">Other Changes</p>
    <p>Because it takes longer for the older brain to process information, it takes longer for an older person to react. The performance of routine tasks takes longer. Combined with normal slowing of movement, ordinary tasks may become more difficult and frustrating for both the older person and their caregiver.</p>

      <li>Participating in “mental aerobics” (art, puzzles, sensory stimulation techniques) to strengthen, improve, and maintain mental and memory capabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can probably think of many other ways to promote intellectual wellness. How can you implement those ideas to stimulate intellectual wellness for your older friends/relatives?</p>
    <p class="subheader">Lifelong Learning</p>
    <p>New learning by older adults should be linked to experiences or activities they are familiar with or have enjoyed, particularly those with a social component. Here are some key facts about older adults and lifelong learning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Older people can learn new information, and new skills.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Sometimes older people feel less confidence in learning new things, but often this is because they haven’t been in a classroom in a long time, or because they are aware of the stereotype and fall into a self-fulfilling prophesy.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Perhaps the best-documented loss in aging is that it takes longer to understand and think about what is being learned. This just means that learning situations for older people should be self-paced without time pressure.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For older learners, active, participatory learning may be more beneficial (and enjoyable) than traditional, lecture-based learning.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Older learners already know more than when they were young. This can be an advantage if they are given the opportunity to reflect on new information to see how it integrates with what they already know.<br>
      </li>
      <li>A supportive learning environment, with positive feedback and encouragement, is beneficial, provided that older learners are treated like adults.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How can you apply these lifelong learning strategies to foster wellness?</p>
    <p class="subheader">Creativity</p>
    <p>Creativity is defined as the skill of producing a work of thought or imagination.</p>
    <p>In his book, The Creative Age: Awakening Human Potential in the Second Half of Life (2000), Gene D. Cohen, MD, PhD, provided striking evidence that the human potential for creativity continues well into old age.</p>
    <p>So, what are some ways to encourage creativity among older friends/relatives? Here are some excerpts from a creative energy workshop.</p>

          </li>

          </li>
          <li>Guess what – you are not the first to make a change. If others can, so can you!</li>

      </li>
      <li>Time to test your capacity for starting creativity.

          <li>Look at ways to bring intergenerational activities into your life. You will be surprised at the variety of perceptions about the same topics.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Spend more time with your older relatives and friends to learn about their history. Along with strengthening family ties, you may learn something new about your older  relatives and friends!</li>

        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class="subheader">Technology and the Future of Caregiving</p>
    <p>The way we care for older adults today cannot scale to meet the looming age wave, and before long we’ll face a fullblown national crisis. We have an obligation to our parents—indeed to the next generation of older adults—to ensure they get the best possible care and that they receive it in a place they want to call home. </p>
    <p>New technology solutions offer great promise to improve quality of care while reducing healthcare costs. Technology already has transformed our lives—from email to MP3s and from online shopping to cell phones. It is time now for technology to transform the experience of aging.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, exciting new technologies coming in the next 5 to 10 years offer the potential to dramatically improve the quality of care we can provide. Watch this video to learn the possibilities!</p>
