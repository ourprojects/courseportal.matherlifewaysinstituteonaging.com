<p><strong>Aging Myths</strong><br />
  Images of aging in our society are not very positive. For example, let&rsquo;s look at some of our stereotypes about older adults:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Old people can&rsquo;t learn new things.</li>
  <li>Old people are close-minded, set in their ways.</li>
  <li>Old people are cantankerous, crabby.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/6/669.full.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Erdman Palmore developed a Facts on Aging quiz</a> to measure perceptions (and misperceptions) about aging. Dr. Palmore&rsquo;s quiz is a good way to look at our concepts of aging.</p>
<p><strong>Realities of Aging</strong><br />
  So, if the stereotype of older adults as slow, sick, and/or senile is false, what is the reality of aging in America? The National Council on the Aging and AARP published the resource,<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Courses/BI_278/projects/Aging/perceptions.pdf" target="_blank"> American Perceptions of Aging in the 21st Century</a>, a longitudinal study that began in 1974.&nbsp; In 2002 a follow-up study compared results from the original 1974 study with contemporary findings. Here are some highlights about the realities of aging:</p>
<ul>
  <li>58% of older adults were very happy with growing older</li>
  <li>88% felt that social relationships were very important to a meaningful, vital life</li>
  <li>32% felt that new learning was very important to a meaningful, vital life</li>
</ul>
<p>How about a few more realities of aging. A survey of key trends in aging conducted by <a href="http://www.matherlifeways.com/re_researchandeducation.asp" target="_blank">Mather LifeWays Institute on Aging</a> documented the following facts about older adults:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The educational level of the older adult population is increasing.</li>
  <li>Almost half of older adults currently do volunteer work.</li>
  <li>More than 75% of older adults say old age should be defined by a decline in physical or mental functioning rather than a specific age.</li>
</ul>

  First of all, how do we define healthy aging? The National Council on the Aging gives this definition:</p>
<p><em>Healthy aging is a broad concept that is more than just physical health status or absence of disease. It encompasses all of the intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual facts of our being. While healthy aging is driven by internal dimensions such as our beliefs, attitudes, and intentions about our health, it also depends on external supports including our social networks, community services, public policies, and the built and natural environment. These dimensions are interrelated, affecting behavior and lifestyle choices.</em></p>
<p><em>Maintaining Physical Health </em><br />
  Research shows that older adults can attain healthy vital old age through simple health promotion and disease prevention initiatives. <a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.3599935/k.1648/John_D__Catherine_T_MacArthur_Foundation.htm" target="_blank">The MacArthur Foundation</a> study and identified several lifestyle changes that clearly proved to benefit older adults:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Exercise and physical activity</em> - 
    Exercise can help prevent heart disease, high blood pressure, and tendency toward diabetes, osteoporosis, and risk for falls. A regular, moderate program of aerobic and strength training for older adults is both safe and effective in improving physical function.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><em>Early detection of cancer</em> - 
    With early detection, many forms of cancer are treatable and have a high survival rate.&nbsp; Fortunately, screening tests for early detection of cancer have become very effective and commonly available. In addition, research suggests that promoting a healthy diet may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer.</li>
  <li><em>Heart disease</em> - 
    Heart disease is a major killer of men at all ages and of older women. Education about reducing risk factors (high cholesterol, smoking, hypertension) is vitally important for older adults.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MacArthur Foundation study documented a number of ways that older adults sustain mental ability as they age. Many of the study&rsquo;s &ldquo;successful agers&rdquo; reported that such activities as reading, conversation, crosswords and other word puzzles, card games, and other similar activities kept their minds alert and active. The study also shows that the strongest predictors of sustained cognitive function include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Education</em> - 
    People with more years of education were more likely to maintain high cognitive function. The study that education early in life may have a direct beneficial effect of brain circuitry, and education may set a pattern of intellectual pursuits, including reading and puzzle solving, which maintains lifelong exercise of cognitive function.</li>
  <li><em>Physical Activity</em> - 
    The study found that older adults who engaged in strenuous physical activity were much more likely to maintain high cognitive function. One possible answer for this is that exercise releases chemicals in the brain which promote the growth of new brain cells.</li>
  <li><em>Self-efficacy</em> - 
    Self-efficacy, or self-esteem, is a person&rsquo;s belief in his or her ability to handle various situations. Many studies show that a strong sense of self-efficacy leads to improved performance in solving cognitive problems. Older adults with strong self-efficacy are more likely to view memory as a set of skills that can be learned and improved.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Engagement in Productive Relationships and Behaviors</em><br />
  The MacArthur research showed that &ldquo;happy activities&rdquo; are essential to successful aging. The two most important areas they identified that contribute to successful aging are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Relating to Others</em> - 
    Being part of a social network of family and friends contributes significantly to successful aging.</li>
  <li><em>Continuing Productive Activity</em> - 
    Most people equate being productive with earning money. However, there are many activities, both paid and unpaid, which can be considered productive. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NORMAL AGING CHANGES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hearing Changes</strong><br />
  More than half of people aged 60 or over are hard of hearing or deaf. Presbycusis is the most common form of hearing loss and is thought to be due to the combined effects of aging of the peripheral or central auditory systems, and the accumulated effects of wear-and-tear. Older adults may compensate for hearing loss by using hearing aids. However, some older adults don’t recognize their problem and some deny they have problems and thus don’t take actions to correct hearing impairments resulting in potential communication problems. These communication problems can lead to social isolation.</p>
<p><em>Strategies for Compensating for Hearing Changes</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand or sit in front of the older adult; get the older adult’s attention.</li>
  <li>Speak up but do not shout.</li>
  <li>Use lower-pitched tones.&nbsp; They are heard more easily than higher ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vision Changes</strong><br />
  About 7.3 million or 21% of persons age 65 and over report some form of vision impairment. As baby boomers age, this number will reach 8.3 million in the year 2010, 11.3 million in 2020, and 14.8 million in 2030. </p>
<p>Vision loss may be due to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decreased pupil size and accommodation which alter visual accuracy</li>
  <li>Macular degeneration which impedes central vision</li>
  <li>Glaucoma which impeded peripheral vision</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Strategies for Compensating for Vision Changes</em><br />
  To accommodate older adults with visual impairments, it is important to make give clear verbal cues to assist the older adult.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are entering a room with someone who is visually impaired, describe the room layout, other people who are in the room, and what is happening. </li>
  <li>Tell the person if you are leaving. Let him/her know if others will remain in the room or if he/she will be alone. </li>
  <li>Allow the person to take your arm for guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes in Smell and Taste</strong><br />
  Decline in smell and taste are also normal aging sensory changes. Older adults recognize and identify common odors less well.&nbsp; Loss of taste and smell are common and result from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal aging from the degeneration of the taste buds, and decreased saliva production</li>
  <li>Certain disease states, such as Alzheimer’s disease</li>
  <li>Medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Sensory losses of taste and smell can cause:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reluctance to talk about food</li>
  <li>Reduced pleasure and comfort from food affecting the socialization that accompanies eating</li>
  <li>Increased nutritional and immune deficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Older adults should be encouraged to have routine oral care and dental visits and to use dentures regularly. To accommodate declines in smell and taste, meals should have pleasing colors, textures, and flavorings to make them look and taste more appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Common Health Issues of Older Adults</strong><br />
  According to <a href="../../system/apps/Assets/Empower/Eng/www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008.../OA_2008.pdf" target="_blank">Older Americans 2008: Key Indicators of Well-Being</a>, published by the Federal Interagency Forum on Age Related Statistics, about 80% of older adults have at least one age-related chronic health condition and 50% have at least two. The most prevalent include:</p>
<p><strong>Cancer</strong> - Older men are at a greater risk of cancer than older women, 24% of older men and 19% of older women having some form of cancer. For men, the most commonly diagnosed cancers included prostate, lung, colon, and rectum. Among women, cancers of the breast, colon, and rectum were the most common.</p>
<p><strong>Osteoporosis</strong> - another common chronic ailment among older adults, reduces bone density and raises the risk for potential disabling fractures.&nbsp; Although women are four times more likely than men to experience bone loss, recent research suggests that the prevalence of osteoporosis among men has been significantly under-diagnosed and under-reported.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer’s Disease</strong> - is a progressive, degenerative disease that causes gradual but irreversible loss of brain cells. It currently affects an estimated 4.5 million Americans, with the vast majority of sufferers being 65 and older. The group of people who are at the highest risk for Alzheimer’s Disease are those age 85 and older, also the fastest growing segment of the population.</p>

<p><strong>AGING WELL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Health and Wellness</strong><br />
  Wellness means striving to achieve the optimum state of health and well-being that you are capable of achieving. The whole-person wellness model, which emphasizes personal choice, self-responsibility, optimism, and self-direction comprises six dimensions of wellness:</p>
<p><em>Physical Wellness</em> includes living an active lifestyle, participating in regular physical activity, eating nutritious foods, and practicing proper self-care.&nbsp; Some ideas for maintaining physical wellness?&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting regular physical exams, including dental and eye</li>
  <li>Maintaining current immunizations</li>
  <li>Eating balanced, nutritious meals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lifelong Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>New learning</strong> by older adults should be linked to experiences or activities they are familiar with or have enjoyed, particularly those with a social component. Here are some key facts about older adults and lifelong learning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Older people can learn new information, and new skills. </li>
  <li>Sometimes older people feel less confidence in learning new things, but often this is because they haven&rsquo;t been in a classroom in a long time, or because they are aware of the stereotype and fall into a self-fulfilling prophesy. </li>
  <li>Perhaps the best-documented loss in aging is that it takes longer to understand and think about what is being learned. This just means that learning situations for older people should be self-paced without time pressure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technology and the Future of Caregiving</strong><br />
  The way we care for older adults today cannot scale to meet the looming age wave, and before long we'll face a fullblown national crisis.  We have an obligation to our parents—indeed to the next generation of older adults—to ensure they get the best possible care and that they receive it in a place they want to call home. New technology solutions offer great promise to improve quality of care while reducing healthcare costs. Technology already has transformed our lives—from email to MP3s and from online shopping to cell phones.  It is time now for technology to transform the experience of aging. Fortunately, exciting new technologies coming in the next 5 to 10 years offer the potential to dramatically improve the quality of care we can provide.  Watch this video to learn the possibilities!</p>
