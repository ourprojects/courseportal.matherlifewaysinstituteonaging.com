    <p><?php echo t('Listening is probably more important that talking when we use CARE Coaching.  Active listening requires giving your full attention, being open and receptive.  Listen to what they are saying and use CARE Coaching techniques to understand and draw out what’s important to them.'); ?></p>

    <p><?php echo t('In terms of CARE Coaching, advocating means supporting one another rather than in the legal sense of defending someone.'); ?></p>
    <p><?php echo t('Reflect back feelings to show that you are hearing and understanding their situation.  Be comfortable with silence as that is the time when the best thinking may be going on.  To make sure that you are clear on what is being said, you may want to say, “I think what you are telling me is….”'); ?></p>
    <p><?php echo t('Setting boundaries is also important.  You can still be an advocate even on the occasion when you need to say “no” to them.  A request may not be reasonable or in your circumstance, you may not be able to comply at this time.

Practice a conversation, particularly if it will be a difficult one, and try to have alternatives ready depending on the response.'); ?></p>
    <p><?php echo t('Just as important as verbal communication, your nonverbal communication – or body language – may speak volumes.  Try to use body language that would be viewed as open and positive – use eye contact, touch, and an open body stance.'); ?></p>
    <h5><?php echo t('Encourage'); ?></h5>
    <p><?php echo t('As the final component of CARE Coaching, encouraging can take on many forms.  Showing appreciation for your parents, letting them know that you realize that they tried to do the best they could.  It is not uncommon for older parents to look back and say, “I wish I could have been a better parent” or “if only I could have given you more when you were growing up.”  That is a great opportunity for you to acknowledge the characteristics that they passed on to you and the valuable things you learned from them.'); ?></p>
