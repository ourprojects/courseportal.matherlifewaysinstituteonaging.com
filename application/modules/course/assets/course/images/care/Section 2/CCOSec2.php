chicken for lunch today. So I think I’d like to try their fish!”'); ?></i></p>

        <li><?php echo t('Place'); ?></li>
        <li><?php echo t('Outcome'); ?></li>
      </ul>
      <p><?php echo t('<b>Timing</b> - Plan to set aside time for conversations with your parents. Be respectful and ask them when would be the best time for them to have these conversations. In turn, make sure you have time to listen. No ringing cell phones at this time! Above all, be patient. Your parents may feel uncomfortable at first with the idea of these conversations and may want to put them off for some time.'); ?></p>
      <p><?php echo t('<b>Experience</b> - A good approach to bringing up these difficult topics is to relate it to your experiences. Some openers sound like this:'); ?></p>
      <p><i><?php echo t('"Dad, I just came from my attorney\'s office. We finished updating my will. I was wondering when the last time you took a look at yours?"'); ?></i></p>
      <p><i><?php echo t('"Mom, a colleague of mine at work just had an unfortunate experience. His father had a sudden heart attack, and it took a long time before they could notify him because his dad did not have any emergency contact information in place. Can we go over how your information is organized particularly since my office recently moved and I have new phone numbers?"'); ?></i></p>
      <p><?php echo t('"It is really gotten to be a challenge driving out there. I am on the road all day and see quite a few bad drivers, especially those on their cell phones. I am concerned about how you are feelings about driving these days."'); ?></p>
      <p><?php echo t('<b>Motivation</b> - Be clear about your motive for having the conversation. The motivating factors should be related to safety, quality of life, and well-being - both theirs and yours. Their best interests are prime consideration, but your life and the lives of your family also matters.'); ?></p>
      <p><?php echo t('<b>Place</b> - The place where these conversations take place needs to be a "safe space" as your parents would define that. It may not necessarily be in their home. Some of these topics are sensitive and so one parent may feel more comfortable taking the lead in the conversations.'); ?></p>
      <p><?php echo t('<b>Outcome</b> - One conversation is not going to address all the important topics that need to be discussed. The initial conversations may be laying the groundwork for you to better understand your parents’ feelings. Not only do you want to get information, but you also want to share information.'); ?></p>
