			<h4>Explore major medical causes of memory loss</h4>

			<p>Dementia refers to an acquired and progressive loss of mental functions due to a
			brain disorder. Memory loss is typically the first symptom shown by someone with
			dementia. This is not a normal part of the aging process, even though the vast majority
			of persons who experience a dementia are over 65 years of age. A medical diagnosis is
			required to determine the underlying cause or causes of symptoms. In the past, terms
			like "senility" and "hardening of the arteries" were commonly used to describe dementia
			but do not accurately explain the disease process at work.</p>

			<p>Without searching the web, which of the following are four types of memory loss?</p>

			<p>
				<label><input type="radio" />Dementia, Alzheimer's, Delirium, Amnesia</label><br />

			<h4>Explanation of types of memory loss</h4>

			<p>Dementia is a slow decline in memory, problem-solving ability, learning ability,
			and judgment that may occur over several weeks to several months. Many health
			conditions can cause dementia or symptoms similar to dementia. In some cases dementia
			may be reversible.</p>

			<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in people older than age
			65.</p>

			<p>Delirium is a sudden change in how well a person's brain is working (mental
			status). Delirium can cause confusion, change the sleep-wake cycles, and cause
			unusual behavior. Delirium can have many causes, such as withdrawal from alcohol or
			drugs or medicines, or the development or worsening of an infection or other health
			problem.</p>

			<p>Amnesia is memory loss that may be caused by a head injury, a stroke, substance
			abuse, or a severe emotional event, such as from combat or a motor vehicle accident.
			Depending upon the cause, amnesia may be either temporary or permanent.</p>

			<p>For additional information on these noted types of memory loss, and for a better
			understanding, please search each of these types on the Web.</p>

			<h4>Dementia &amp; Alzheimer's Disease</h4>

			<h3>About Dementia</h3>

			<p>Dementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a wide range
			of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough
			to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Dementia is often
			incorrectly referred to as "senility" or "senile dementia," which reflects the formerly
			widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of
			aging.</p>

			<h3>Symptoms and signs of dementia</h3>

			<p>While symptoms of dementia can vary greatly, at least two of the following core
			mental functions must be significantly impaired to be considered dementia:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Memory</li>
				<li>Communication and language</li>
				<li>Ability to focus and pay attention</li>
				<li>Reasoning and judgment</li>
				<li>Visual perception</li>
			</ul>

			<p>People with dementia may have problems with short-term memory, keeping track of a
			purse or wallet, paying bills, planning and preparing meals, remembering appointments
			or traveling out of the neighborhood. Many dementias are progressive, meaning symptoms
			start out slowly and gradually get worse.</p>

			<h3>About Alzheimer's Disease</h3>

			<p>Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and
			behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe
			enough to interfere with daily tasks.</p>

			<h3>Alzheimer's basics</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia</li>
				<li>Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging</li>
				<li>Alzheimer's worsens over time</li>
				<li>Alzheimer's has no current cure, but treatments for symptoms are available and
				research continues.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Delirium &amp; Amnesia</h3>

			<h4>About Delirium</h4>

			<p>Delirium is sudden severe confusion and rapid changes in brain function that occur
			with physical or mental illness. Delirium is most often caused by physical or mental
			illness and is usually temporary and reversible. Many disorders cause delirium,
			including conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen or other substances.</p>

			<h4>Symptoms of Delirium</h4>

			<ul>
			<li>Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less alert at
			night)</li>

			<li>Changes in feeling (sensation) and perception</li>

			<li>Changes in level of consciousness or awareness</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>About Amnesia</h4>

			<p>Amnesia is a condition in which one's memory is lost. The memory can be either
			wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused. The causes of
			amnesia have traditionally been divided into certain categories. Memory appears to be
			stored in several parts of the limbic system of the brain. Any condition that
			interferes with the function of this system can cause amnesia.</p>

			<h4>Symptoms of Amnesia</h4>

			<ul>
			<li>Impaired ability to learn new information following the onset of amnesia
			(anterograde amnesia)</li>

			<li>Impaired ability to recall past events and previously familiar information
			(retrograde amnesia)</li>
			</ul>
