		<h4>Explore major medical causes of memory loss</h4>

		<p>Dementia refers to an acquired and progressive loss of mental
			functions due to a brain disorder. Memory loss is typically the first
			symptom shown by someone with dementia. This is not a normal part of
			the aging process, even though the vast majority of persons who
			experience a dementia are over 65 years of age. A medical diagnosis
			is required to determine the underlying cause or causes of symptoms.
			In the past, terms like "senility" and "hardening of the arteries"
			were commonly used to describe dementia but do not accurately explain
			the disease process at work.</p>

		<p>Without searching the web, which of the following are four types of
			memory loss?</p>

		<p>
			<label><input type="radio" />Dementia, Alzheimer's, Delirium, Amnesia</label><br />

		<h4>Explanation of types of memory loss</h4>

		<p>Dementia is a slow decline in memory, problem-solving ability,
			learning ability, and judgment that may occur over several weeks to
			several months. Many health conditions can cause dementia or symptoms
			similar to dementia. In some cases dementia may be reversible.</p>

		<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in people
			older than age 65.</p>

		<p>Delirium is a sudden change in how well a person's brain is working
			(mental status). Delirium can cause confusion, change the sleep-wake
			cycles, and cause unusual behavior. Delirium can have many causes,
			such as withdrawal from alcohol or drugs or medicines, or the
			development or worsening of an infection or other health problem.</p>

		<p>Amnesia is memory loss that may be caused by a head injury, a
			stroke, substance abuse, or a severe emotional event, such as from
			combat or a motor vehicle accident. Depending upon the cause, amnesia
			may be either temporary or permanent.</p>

		<p>For additional information on these noted types of memory loss, and
			for a better understanding, please search each of these types on the
			Web.</p>

		<h4>Dementia &amp; Alzheimer's Disease</h4>

		<h3>About Dementia</h3>

		<p>Dementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that
			describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in
			memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's
			ability to perform everyday activities. Dementia is often incorrectly
			referred to as "senility" or "senile dementia," which reflects the
			formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline
			is a normal part of aging.</p>

		<h3>Symptoms and signs of dementia</h3>

		<p>While symptoms of dementia can vary greatly, at least two of the
			following core mental functions must be significantly impaired to be
			considered dementia:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Memory</li>
			<li>Communication and language</li>
			<li>Ability to focus and pay attention</li>
			<li>Reasoning and judgment</li>
			<li>Visual perception</li>
		</ul>

		<p>People with dementia may have problems with short-term memory,
			keeping track of a purse or wallet, paying bills, planning and
			preparing meals, remembering appointments or traveling out of the
			neighborhood. Many dementias are progressive, meaning symptoms start
			out slowly and gradually get worse.</p>

		<h3>About Alzheimer's Disease</h3>

		<p>Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory,
			thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse
			over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.</p>

		<h3>Alzheimer's basics</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia</li>
			<li>Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging</li>
			<li>Alzheimer's worsens over time</li>
			<li>Alzheimer's has no current cure, but treatments for symptoms are
				available and research continues.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Delirium &amp; Amnesia</h3>

		<h4>About Delirium</h4>

		<p>Delirium is sudden severe confusion and rapid changes in brain
			function that occur with physical or mental illness. Delirium is most
			often caused by physical or mental illness and is usually temporary
			and reversible. Many disorders cause delirium, including conditions
			that deprive the brain of oxygen or other substances.</p>

		<h4>Symptoms of Delirium</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less
				alert at night)</li>

			<li>Changes in feeling (sensation) and perception</li>

			<li>Changes in level of consciousness or awareness</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>About Amnesia</h4>

		<p>Amnesia is a condition in which one's memory is lost. The memory
			can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage
			that was caused. The causes of amnesia have traditionally been
			divided into certain categories. Memory appears to be stored in
			several parts of the limbic system of the brain. Any condition that
			interferes with the function of this system can cause amnesia.</p>

		<h4>Symptoms of Amnesia</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Impaired ability to learn new information following the onset of
				amnesia (anterograde amnesia)</li>

			<li>Impaired ability to recall past events and previously familiar
				information (retrograde amnesia)</li>
		</ul>
